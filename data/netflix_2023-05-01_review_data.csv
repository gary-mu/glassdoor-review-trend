Amazing Company to work for!,2023-04-26,"Talent Acquisition Coordinator in Los Angeles, CA",5,,-Great team and really embodied the culture memo with an all star team -Great leadership that supported me through growth and development into a different department,-High volume of work but can be manageable if you create solutions for the business and ask for support -Consistent org changes that make it difficult to always be the SME in your space or new leadership that changes
How much does a functioning human cost?,2018-09-20,Anonymous Employee,3,,- Paycheck - So many good people - Such a great service - Hope,"I have been working for a year at Netflix.  I've seen what was supposed to be very mature people, sharing absolutely almost no contact that anyone would qualify as ""human"". Sure, that sounds hyperbolic, let me develop (and maybe cherry-pick a little).  Have you heard about our culture? The one about giving candid feedback? - I have seen people complaining of behavior they literally demonstrated themselves in the following days. But I have also seen these feedbacks resulting in tears both in the eyes of HR persons or fellow engineers. How human does that sound?  Have you heard about our culture? The one about not tolerating brilliant jerks? I have nonetheless seen angriness and frustration, expressed in private, public and meeting. People rejecting new ideas by default, like, any ideas they wouldn't have worked themselves on for days wouldn't count. Even if those ideas are from the best examples in the industry or academics. How many publications/contributions have you seen from Netflix to computer science in general? How does it compare against any other company of that size in the Bay Area? Can you imagine either the real insecurity (x)or the lack of innovation that could lead to this situation?  Except for a few managers, directors or VPs feeling free enough to behave at work in the same way than how they live, almost every engineer I have been interacting with, have shared as little as possible about their private life. The rare exceptions of interpersonal exchange ends up around some sort of competitive behavior: Who is the most geeky, sportive, owns the fastest car/biggest house/visited the strangest place.  I've heard workaholic people complaining about ambitious peers who were over-managing, over-working to get even more work to do after. I feel like we're past workaholism at this point.  Maybe there are a lot of shy people! Maybe there is a culture of fear, not only of being fired, but also a fear of interacting with people going to be fired. Maybe it's all in my head, maybe people giving 5 stars to their experience here don't care the human aspect of a company. And maybe they're right.  What about your crush, your fears, your desires for the future, your appetite for life? I've been blessed to work in enough large companies to know that the behavior that I'm seeing in Netflix is not a healthy one. I've also been lucky enough to work in other industries more socializing than tech and I can tell that Netflix has a lot to do on that side, and off-sites or team meeting won't solve that problem.  I am afraid about the tragic, but inevitable consequences of the ways people operate in this company: I guess that the day the worst will happen, it will be addressed in an impersonal memo by Reed; followed-up by 1 or 2 reminders during offsites. Possibly commented by HR in a Q&A document. And move on. This company seems as reactive in its management of people as it is proactive in its business operations.  I still work at Netflix though, not only for the paycheck, but because I hope. I hope it will change. The needed change can't happen from a candid feedback, a Q&A, or only from inside. Change has to come from everyone, including people who take time to read comments like this one. Netflix has so many good people and offers such a great service.  As a curious Netflix employee reading this review: think about your past, isn't there a big human thing that you would love to feel again in your current company that you've felt in the past?  As a candidate: think about what would be a good question to ask to that HR partner once your package is almost here to be offered to you, think about that comment you make at the end of an interview when you're being asked by an engineer: ""Do you have any question for me?"" What Netflix needs is an inception, something that anyone and everyone would think about after leaving the call or the room they were sharing with you. Ask yourself, and then the others, the question you should ask if you think you want to spend a good amount of your life and energy in the place you're applying for.  - Will I learn and contribute to the knowledge of other's? Even outside the company? - Will I see emotional responses from my peers? Will that be for other reasons than being fired or bluntly criticized? - Will I find a friendly environment that will nurture my appetite for life? - What is the amount of emotional interaction (celebrating, sharing, playing) to expect from a company whose service is the best to ""entertain""? - Do androids dream of electric sheep?"
"high performing environment, fantastic benefits, trust and results earn a lot of freedom",2023-01-30,"Marketing Director in Los Angeles, CA",5,,"great benefits, best salary around, beautiful offices and you will work amongst some of the smartest folks you have ever met, plus you are talking about tv and movies all day - it's a FUN job","the company has grown rapidly over the last few years and during covid - the previous way of onboarding and building trust was much harder to achieve. I was at Netflix new many growth phases and this one is definitely the hardest - there are a ton of talent people in the marketing department that have been there a long time (e.g. more than 4 years) but not a lot of upward mobility so it feels like folks are getting restless. It has also become a much more political environment where it feels like leadership is most focused on decision making based on perception vs. what is best for the work and the teams. If you are a used to a political environment, this may not bother you."
Love it here!,2023-04-26,"Creative Editor in San Francisco, CA",5,,Love it here great place that promotes grow from within,Hours could take a toll on one who is not passionate about the job
Netflix is not for everybody,2019-05-22,"Senior Software Engineer in Los Gatos, CA",3,,"The best part about Netflix is that they try to pay 20% more than everybody else, so the compensation is good. They are not shy about spending money, so travel is business class, you'll get a new MacBook Pro every year, etc. The people there tend to be very nice, the catered lunch is delicious, and so forth. While there is still a lot of action in Los Gatos building the technology (although arguably it is becoming mature, as streaming is a commodity), the real drama is in Los Angeles, relating to content.","Netflix has very strange politics, because people's jobs are at the whim of their manager. In other words, if a manager decides that a particular report is no longer a ""star,"" he or she will get a package. So, given that employees are not stupid, there is a lot of kissing up, resulting in a lot of comedy. Netflix believes in ""360 feedback,"" but everybody I know only does that to their peers, and they become very political with their management chain."
Not bad,2023-04-29,"Product Manager in New York, NY",2,,Good wages and benefits here,Less free time is not good
Fun Times,2023-04-27,"Engineering Manager in Los Angeles, CA",4,,Good Culture. Most diversity in leadership I've ever seen. They treat you like a grown-up,Lack of consistency between teams and orgs can be challenging to navigate
Great company,2023-04-14,"Customer Service Representative in Salt Lake City, UT",5,,Competitive salary and fun environment,None that I can think of
Love it here!,2023-03-14,Senior Software Engineer,5,,"- Great teammates and collaboration, people seek out problems and solutions proactively - Pleasant people to work with, I don't dislike anyone I work with, anyone that has been a problem in the past, has not lasted long. - Interesting ongoing innovation - Fully remote is a blessing","- Sad to see Reed step down as CEO - Sometimes poor communication, learn about business decisions on twitter/reddit/news before hearing about internally"
Ex-PA,2023-04-26,"Post PA in Los Angeles, CA",2,,Work closely with famous directors & editors,"Low paying, long hours, bad personalities, extra unpaid work"
Good and bad,2022-11-11,Finance,3,,"Great pay, lots of freedom to own your work","Because of the memo and meeting heavy culture, things can take forever. My small team would schedule numerous meetings to prepare for a meeting with colleagues on another team even when one session was barely necessary. And low visibility/risk 10-15 minute group presentations for teammates ended up being hours and hours of prep. Again, unnecessary and a waste of time just to make a big deal out of a simple thing that could've been talked through."
Great opportunity,2023-01-17,Associate Brand Manager,5,,Great work environment and people,Not being able to be remote
Not good,2023-02-11,Human Resources,1,,Money was good for if,People were bad for if

Netflix Stop Motion Rigger,2022-08-23,"Stop Motion Rigger in Milwaukie, OR",5,,"It was a short-term gig for a Henry Selick movie. I was there for only a year, and it was a great gig. We did not have all the usual benefits as most Netflix employees, but they treated us well, and I do not have many complaints.","They need to fix their email system. You are inundated with emails all day, and it is difficult to figure out and navigate what is important. Similar to their platform, you cannot find anything you want to read or watch. Other than that, I do not have that many cons. They treated me well."
Great!,2023-01-09,Manager,5,,Great culture and great pay,"Very demanding, and can feel overworked sometimes"
Netflix is the bomb!,2022-12-19,Production Assistant,5,,Learned a lot from industry professionals and had some great experiences on set.,"A few people in the crew were not used to working on a team, but we worked through it!"
EA,2023-01-06,"Executive Assistant in Los Angeles, CA",4,,Great company to work for with some amazing benefits,Tough culture and cut throat envrionment
Awesome,2023-01-10,"Software Engineer in Dallas, TX",5,,Great team to work with.,None for me to list.

Mech,2022-12-03,"Mechanical Engineer in Portland, ME",4,,Good work in mech is appreciated,Non good work is important
Job sucks,2022-11-28,Customer Service Representative,4,,We get free Netflix from working there,Customers are really annoying overall
Cool Place for name gratification but can get sticky in the D&I weeds,2022-04-29,"IT Manager in Los Angeles, CA",3,,Great Name Great Pay Free Food Get to see your work Directly influence outcome on product or specific initiatives ALL CASH COMP!,"Over indulge on the D&I portion of things...but not in a good way. It feels very performative and you as a minority end up taking on correcting colleagues that don't otherwise have the best understanding how to talk to or work with people from diverse backgrounds. Also, the work is generally project based, and often once your project is complete you're left at the mercy of your director or manager as to whether or not you get to keep your job. The culture is very...ambiguous...similar to the bible people apply their own interpretation and there's no real system of accountability in place. Your manager can say keeping your camera off during a meeting is an example of ""poor judgment"" and use it to fire you. TLDR...it can be cut throat...if you get in take it all in cash and trust no one."
Great Company,2022-09-08,Administrative Assistant,5,,This is a great company to work for and they have great benefits.,Fast paced company that keeps you on your toes.
Great company,2022-09-23,Anonymous Employee,5,,Great company Amazing culture stunning coworkers,pretty tough to move teams
Dynamic business,2022-11-16,Director of Public Affairs,3,,An agile company focused on living its culture intentionally.,Tremendous potential to shape its environment but a low-key approach in certain areas.
Not the company it once was,2022-10-01,"Engineering Manager in Los Gatos, CA",3,,Big name All cash comp (for now),Cost cutting environment Management lacks vision No longer high talent density
Great,2022-09-01,"Visual Development Artist in Burbank, CA",5,,Really tries to listen to employee's needs.,"Lots of growing pains on the animation side. Animation & rest of Netflix not treated equally (paternity/maternity leave, etc)."
"One of the greats, losing some luster",2022-09-25,Senior Software Engineer,4,,"Depending on department, still an excellent place to work Very smart colleagues, good benefits, interesting challenges","Trying to become more corporate, and really struggling to do it well; e.g. badly executed layoffs, poor rollout of engineering levels"
Not the Best Place for the Family-Oriented,2022-07-28,Team Lead,2,,Always had contests to make the work environment a great place to work.,I do not know if the stressful calls without much help for management is worth sticking around for the contests. Seems like there is always a shift bid going on and the available shifts change dramatically within each 3 month period. This makes it hard for people with kids. You may get a 6am to 2pm shift one time and then company will get rid of that shift all together and depending on where you are in seniority or stats you could end up with a 4pm to midnight shift. You just never know.
"Fast paced, freedom and responsibility",2022-07-17,Senior Software Engineer,4,,High degree of freedom for engineers.,Sometimes it can feel that the company is a bit disorganized.
"Strong talent pool, top of market compensation",2022-01-29,"Technical Program Manager in New York, NY",5,,1. Strong talent pool means you can rack up accomplishments easily and accelerate your learning and career growth.  2. Top of personal market compensation essentially means that you won’t get paid more elsewhere.  3. Lean company that aims to maximize impact by limiting the amount of overhead to a minimum. Doesn’t feel overly bureaucratic.,"1. You will be let go for poor performance — quickly.  2. Tough to break into management. Once you have obtained the scope you’re comfortable with, it’s better to jump ship than try to play games climbing here."
fine,2022-07-27,"Project Manager in India, TX",3,,"flexible, experience, light enough ok","no benefits, overheads by company"
Mixed bag,2022-06-01,Senior Engineer,3,,Great pay Some pretty smart people Cool product,"Lots of documents, yet very little documentation Every team does things differently, for better or worse Being lean means many single points of failure and context silos"
Great place,2022-07-18,Anonymous Employee,5,,"Great benefits, workers, and structure",A lot of responsibilities that was not part of my job
Best company to work in California,2022-07-16,Anonymous Employee,4,,Good culture across the bay area,Hectic work hours and little bit of stress

great place to work,2022-07-18,Project Manager,5,,The benefits are great indeed.,There are not many cons actually.
Netflix Review,2022-07-04,"Executive Assistant in Los Angeles, CA",4,,The salaries are great and so are the benefits.,The culture is a little weird and some of the people/execs can be too.
great company,2022-07-06,"Senior Software Engineer in Los Gatos, CA",4,,good culture and remote friendly great perks at work too,leadership is getting too top heavy
Wonderful supportive company,2022-04-29,Senior Recruiter,5,,The people and culture are the company's number one asset.,Work is exciting and impactful which means demanding but I see that more as a positive.
great,2022-05-26,"Software Engineer in New York, NY",5,,"interesting work, autonomy, no politics",it's a media company now
Horrible company - great pay,2022-06-23,Anonymous Employee,1,,"Pay, that’s basically it. Pay is good",Horrible management who does not enact the culture they preach
Different company than in the past,2020-11-22,Corporate,3,,1. Top pay 2. Exciting company doing great things 3. Smart people,"1. Definitely a culture of fear. People are let go constantly if they're not performing. The company is very open about this part of their culture, so just know what you're getting in to. 2. Company used to have a very strong culture (read their culture memo). That culture has evolved and, in the opinion of many people who've been there for a while, eroded. People regularly ignore key principles of the culture. Part of it is due to the company's rapid growth. Netflix with 8000 employees is very different from Netflix with 1000 employees 6-7 years ago. That level of rapid growth seriously diluted the culture. 3. Much less freedom & responsibility than in the past. Becoming more bureaucratic and political. 4. Much less forthright and candid from management. For example, management recently got rid of the 5% free options. Management framed it as more choice for employees (as the 5% free options were converted to cash salary, which employees can then allocate to options if they want), but as the comp philosophy of top of market typically didn't take into account the 5% free options, employees viewed this move as management disingenuously reducing salaries by 5%. 5. because there are so many more employees, career growth is much more limited (just a natural consequence of greater number of employees, more niche roles, etc.)."
Good Learning Experience,2022-04-25,"Manager in Los Angeles, CA",4,,"Great people, high compensation, incredible perks, solid transparency",Culture was changing away from a hyper growth oriented group towards a less-results more policial culture
creative executive,2022-05-13,"Director in Los Angeles, CA",5,,Love the company culture and my department in particular,none to report at the moment
Overall a nice place to work virtually,2022-04-30,Story Artist,4,,- Friendly co-workers - Paid well - Accommodating for virtual working,Hard to explain but there wasn't a big sense of community.
great company heading in the wrong direction,2022-05-09,Senior Data Scientist,3,,great people great culture great comp,culture was eroding - heading in the wrong direction
Netflix is truly the best company I have ever worked for,2021-03-07,"Administrative Assistant in Los Angeles, CA",5,,"Culture Values are held to a high standard. There has been a very large emphasis on inclusion & diversity, specifically in the past couple of years. I would say 90% of the people that work there are absolute rock stars. What the company focuses on as a whole is bringing joy to our members and encouraging creativity in storytelling.","It seems your ability to get promoted depends on your manager or director, and not necessarily if someone has proven themselves capable. There are many teams that promote when someone has shown themselves to be invaluable members of the team at Netflix. However, other teams seem to make promotions a bit political. I have really only seen this with my specific team, which leads me to believe it is involved with our specific leaders and their management styles, not the company as a whole as many other cross-functional teams do not do this."
Leadership needs an overhaul,2021-10-26,"Physical Production in Los Angeles, CA",3,,Great pay and stunning colleagues,Bad managers. Politics creeping in. Bad decisions getting made.
Attorney,2022-01-13,Business and Legal Affairs,5,,Exciting work (with best in class) that is highly compensated.,Numerous reorgs makes many feel unstable.

Good,2022-03-30,Mail Processing Clerk,4,,Enjoyed my former coworkers. It was challenging.,Not able to continue working there unfortunately company closed down.
Great place to work,2021-12-13,"Storyboard Revisionist in Hollywood, CA",5,,-Good Pay -Inclusive culture -Lots of events -Lots of career opportunities,-No real cons here. A good place to work.
Culture & Values vs Politics & Process,2021-11-23,Anonymous Employee,2,,Amazing exposure to all parts of the company and business. Incredible colleagues who are driven and responsible. Good pay and benefits.,Worked 70+ hour weeks for several years - the workload is huge. Re-org'ed 7 times in less than 4 years and reported to different departments and people each time. Difficult to get your sea legs in a constantly changing environment. Advancement is challenging due to the constant restructuring. The culture values are used for internal political posturing.
Pretty Good,2022-01-30,"Manager in Los Angeles, CA",4,,"Cool lunch bar, Employee benefits, best entertainment company",Hard to move as people don't leave
Best place I've ever worked,2021-08-24,"Program Manager in Los Angeles, CA",5,,"Netflix truly cares about its employees. The culture is lived and breathed, not just words on a wall. Transparency is practiced daily. Best place I've ever worekd.",None I can think of

Netflix Culture is a JOKE,2021-12-14,Anonymous Employee,2,,Compensation is top of market,They don’t follow their own Culture Memo. Inclusion and Diversity only exists at lower levels.

Fun work,2021-12-14,Anonymous Employee,4,,They have great pay and benefits,"Part of the WOKE movement entirely. Want diversity, just not diversity of thought."
Supportive team,2021-11-30,Anonymous Employee,4,,"I absolutely love the people I work with, even the execs make it easy to bring up ideas and are open to listening.",Culture including 360 reviews aren’t helpful only because it feels more like a task that needs to be checked off the list
Toxic and elitist,2022-02-14,Technical Researcher - Sourcing,1,,They pay well and the benefits are ok.,Worst work environment I have been in since starting my career. Its kind of like being back in High School.
Quite a few inconsistencies with the Netflix culture document,2019-03-17,Anonymous Employee,3,,"1. Little red tape 2. Compensation 3. Freedom with expenses, travel, WFH 4. Communication flows extremely well throughout the organization","1. The feedback I got was only positive. So, I did not experience 'we tell people things to their face' 2. Internally strong leadership is defined as 'have you let anyone go' rather than showing good judgement and making good decisions 3. Managers have no prior experience and lack people skills.  4. In data science, it seems to be about writing papers than having business impact. The system is optimized towards presenting in monthly and quarterly meetings than creating actionable recommendations.  5. Sourcing team is incompetent and as managers you have to do your own sourcing. They are far worse than Amazon and Facebook.  6. There is no growth position wise for individual contributors. This is a consequence of having a flat structure.  7. Disagreeing with a VP who has limited visibility into your group can be fairly negative. As managers showing a back bone can be negative. It's encouraged in the document but not advisable in practice."
Great Experience and Great Responsibility,2021-03-02,"Post Production Assistant in Los Angeles, CA",5,,"Learning so much about the industry I want to go in, and being trusted with more tasks when I prove myself.","Since everyone operates at such a high caliber, it can sometimes feel like you’re defined more by your mistakes than your successes. 1:1’s with management are helpful for constructive criticism if you’re worried about this."

Amazing company to work for,2021-03-15,"Workplace Experience Manager in Hollywood, CA",5,,The culture is definitely a pro for me. The freedom we get at Netflix makes you feel as you are your own boss at times which is motivating to work for.,The pressure of working for such a successful company with top talent in the industry.

awesome,2021-06-09,"Software Engineer in New York, NY",4,,great people and manageable workload,cannot get an easy promotion
A roller coaster ride of excitement and stress,2014-11-17,"Senior Software Engineer in Los Gatos, CA",4,,"Excellent salary, smart people, great time flexibility, satisfying projects. The company values of freedom and responsibility are really like treating employees like adults and trusting them to execute the best overall decisions for the company, which is effective when enough context is given. Innovation and experimentation is rewarded well and many opportunities for ongoing education are offered.","Internal politics. Lots of blame game behavior played as subtly (yet transparently if you pay attention) as possible. Some managers spend too much time in the code instead of managing their team. I had the experience of offering many recommendations for improving team performance and not having them implemented because the culture here is to just do what you want and either get rewarded hugely or sacked. Management coaching appears to be improving, but inconsistently applied. I've seen people who need to be let go stay on for a long time with many opportunities to change and people who were very competent let go without much warning that they need to change something. I've also seen projects executed that solved the business problems presented but were dropped because management didn't like it rather than some other specific reasons."

A successful cult,2009-11-14,"Director in Los Gatos, CA",3,,"Pay Lots of smart people around you all working as hard as you do to make company succeed Strangers say ""I love that company"", this will always make you feel good","Always on -- blackberries are assigned on entrance to corporate and you can bet your bottom dollar that no matter where you are, you will be expected to at least stay on top of the latest, if not participate. Hyper insular culture -- the fallacy of success pervades this company like no other. VPs are never wrong, even when they are, because the companies' success surely must be a reflection of the VPs and C level people's prior decisions. Challenge the VPs more than once and you will be sure not to last too long Related to always on: incessant pressure. Since as early as the first round interviews you are informed that you may be let go any day for any reason, you will spend at the least the first 12 months in chronic fear. Once out of the first 12 months, you will always hear that voice in the back of your head say, ""you better work harder or the ax may fall tomorrow."""

They encourage ""transparency"" but the moment you speak out too much or to the wrong person, you automatically have a bullseye on you. Yes, people are often let go all the time with very little context or insight.   Netflix culture stresses ""stunning colleagues"" but in reality, it's a very superficial environment where people who suck up to the right people or ""SAY YES"" types are the only ones who do well.  Oh and despite being a ""fast moving"" company, there's little room for internal growth. What you get hired in as will most likely be your one and only position with the company."

"High Standards, High Performers",2019-10-30,"Technical Research Analyst in Salt Lake City, UT",5,,"* The environment is fast-paced and constantly changing - you'll never find yourself bored, and you will always find there is more to learn. * The perks and compensation are top-of-market. * Communication is open and regular. * Management are all very talented, thoughtful leaders. * An environment full of high performing individuals, all of whom are dedicated to doing great work.","Not many for me, but the culture is not for everybody. Netflix is very feedback-oriented: they will tell you early and often when you could have done something better. And they expect you to do the same for them. Some people are not accustomed to handling this kind of constant, direct honesty.'  They also do not keep dead weight. If you are not succeeding, they will tell you, and they will give you the tools you need to improve. If you cannot improve, and they've invested too much in trying to get you to where you need to be, then they will find someone else. Again, this is actually really great for those who can keep up and appreciate being surrounded by talented people. It's not so great for those who underperform."

Netflix's Dysfunctional Culture,2016-07-01,,2,,"The product is interesting, and most people are nice and well-intentioned, though a little drunk on the Kool-Aid. There's a lot of benefits in the 401K match, matching donations, and monetary perks. It's pretty good in terms of work-life balance.","Where do I begin? Most of the hard algorithmic problems have already been solved at Netflix. Most of the hard scaling problems have already been solved by Amazon-- and most engineers at Netflix write thin REST services. It's not rocket science. But the way folks discuss their work, you'd think we were working at Space X. Good thing engineering management is clueless and arrogant, and more interested in engineering by powerpoint than solving real problems. In general, there's a 'not invented here' syndrome which permeates groups, and so a lot of reinventing the wheel. The compensation is bloated, so people are trying to maximize their paychecks. It leads to poor behavior- personal branding is more important than solving problems and petty personal politics and territorial struggles are more important than collaboration. All in all, a great place to get a fat paycheck, but day to day, the work is uninspiring. If you want a real engineering driven culture, led by engineers I'd suggest going to Facebook or Google."
The cracks start to show pretty quickly.,2012-04-10,"CSR-1 in Hillsboro, OR",2,,"Well-paying for a call center, free fruit, cheap soda, a nice building, free Netflix.","Your work experience almost depends entirely on your manager, and your manager may or may not change every month. Things that one manager may not care about (and tell you not to worry about) will be brought up against you six months later as a final warning. Sometimes policies are suggestions and other times they are concrete, and this will change at random and get you terminated. This isn't just on the ground floor either, one day everything's fine and the next ten managers are let go and their teams dispersed amongst the remaining set (but everything's still fine guys, don't worry). There is almost zero room for advancement, managers are hired in from the outside and the best anyone hired at entry-level can expect is to become a CSR-2, a position that doesn't actually pay more. Anyone and everyone competent seemed to slowly leave for better jobs in my time there, and at first I wondered why when they had so much going on, but eventually I figured it out.  Decent pay if you can stick it out, but way more stressful than it needs to be, and I'm not talking about the customers; an old man yelling at you for thirty minutes because his blu-ray stopped working is nothing compared to not knowing if you're going to be fired that week because you had a sick day three months ago and your calls aren't short enough."

Stay Away. You do not want to work here.,2010-11-03,"in Hillsboro, OR",2,,Nice location New management that has been brought in knows what they are doing Free coffee and Netflix account Benefits are ok Pay is good,Really scary place to work. There is so much fear in the culture in the call center that it is difficult to work there. The new Director is a joke. He has no idea what he is doing and is making decisions that will hurt the call center. There are few people who respect him as a leader and we look to our Managers for guidance.  There is no clear direction and even though they talk about coaching their people it is not true. The coaching has no impact and people are fired due to not being supported properly.  There are so many other Supervisors looking for jobs because they cannot stand it there. I cannot wait to get a new job.  Attrition there is so high. You can see new people brought in and the next few months they are gone. I have never seen a place tat makes so many snap decisions on people which supports the fact that Netflix does not focus on people development.
Sword of Damocles,2012-07-25,"Director in Los Gatos, CA",3,,"- great physical work environment in Los Gatos - great co workers: highly motivated, intelligent, impressive experiences. Netflix hires people at the peak of their games - at the time (2007-2010), it was an exciting time of growth in the online streaming space, with consistent growth in the DVD space; fun to be on the cutting edge, and high growth. - great compensation; employees are well paid","- there is a constant sword of damocles (i.e. the threat of removal) hanging over your head. even when you think you are doing well, you can be released unexpectedly, at a moment's notice. (this results in a culture of fear) - there is no career path; Netflix hires you to perform a job, and once that job is over, it's easier for them to let you go rather than retrain or relocate you. - this is not the place to be if you want work/life balance; not family friendly"
Good but not so good,2015-09-10,"Customer Service Representative in Salt Lake City, UT",3,,"Great coworkers, free netflix , tools available to complete job, swag, easy for call center work, great benefits and pay.","I'm a good agent, I have great stats and get along well with management and coworker. however, i don't even feel secure in my job. Management really needs to get it together. It feels like high school with how much you hear the cool kids ""supervisors"" talk about agents openly while others can hear them. Netflix also will say they are ""transparent"" this is not the case. ""Corporate told us, we didn't know"" is a poor excuse."
"It was absolutely awesome, until I was let go.",2011-07-14,"Training Supervisor in Hillsboro, OR",4,,"Great Pay. Excellent Benefits. Smart, hardworking teammates. Opportunities to excel, be creative, be strategic. Managers are all excellent at managing their people, especially if you are a top performer they are hands off and supportive.","To be honest, I loved pretty much every day up until I was let go based off a rumor. The biggest problem is that in order to be successful at in the call center you have to ""drink the Kool Aid."" Which in all honesty I was happy to do, I got to work with some really rad people, and do really great work that I'm proud of. However, karma is, well you know karma is, and I let go of a lot of people that probably felt like it wasn't fair, and eventually the same thing happened to me. Loyalty to employees is not one of their strong suits."
Customer Care Representative I,2015-04-19,"Csr1 in Beaverton, OR",1,,- Unlimited overtime - Snacks in the break room - Fast moving - Meeting a lot of new people - $14/hr for no education required - Benefits,"- Incredibly high turnover of employees. Rather than investing in training, they just hired large swathes of people and then fired the ones that they didn't like. - A lot of burn out. People getting overworked was very common. On my first week there a girl burst into tears, ran out of the building, and didn't come back. - Completely unrealistic expectations on calls. For example: 97% of callers have to rate you positively at the end of the call; the call needs to be under 3.5 minutes; you cannot transfer more than X amount to a supervisor; you have to keep the replacement CDs you send under X amount - Everything, from the time you spent in the restroom, to the time you spent on a certain type of call, is broken down to the second and charted  - Honestly the most hostile environment I have ever been in. I went in every day thinking I would be fired. After 1 year and 1 month of working there (generally 50+ hours a week), I got fired for burnout."
If Netflix was a TV show: Action Series with a Hint of Survivor,2011-01-22,"Engineering Manager in Los Gatos, CA",5,,"* ""Freedom and Responsibility Culture"" = Lots of individual control (Read Reed's slide deck) * If you're part of a well-run team, you'll love it - Excellent compensation - Unique stock option program with personal choice for $$$ allocated - Fast-paced environment with lots of challenges - It's the largest streaming movie service in the world and it's just getting better - Extremely open with corporate information sharing (no internal culture of secrecy like Apple) - Incredible execution over the last couple years - the methods can be controversial, but you can't argue with the quarterly/annual results","* ""High Performance Culture"" = You can hang yourself easily and get canned (Read Reed's slide deck) * If you join a mis-managed group, you'll be posting a negative review on here soon. :-) - Average benefits programs - Inexperienced managers can mis-apply the ""high performance culture"" philosophy and lead to the ""culture of fear"" some people have complained about in certain organizations - Double-standard for performance: VP/C-level staff appear immune from ""high performance culture"". Reed rocks, but some of the others are average/good, not exceptional."
"For Engineers, this place is a joke",2012-12-12,"Senior Software Engineer in Los Gatos, CA",1,,You're given independence and the ability to do your job how you see fit - some of the time. Most of the time management runs around like a chicken with their collective head cut off and priorities constantly change.,"- The salaries are competitive, but not particularly high, despite what their so called slide deck proclaims. Keep in mind that your stock purchase and ""bonus"" is included, so $160k at Google is the same as $210k at Netflix.  - Constant threats of firing, a culture of fear and throwing other employees under the bus to save your own skin. The threats of firing lead to crunch and absurd stress levels.  - Employees aren't as intelligent as other high tech firms, they're hired more for the ability to play corporate politics than technical skill.  - To follow on the above, the average stay here seems to be about a year. Understand that Netflix isn't an engineering company, it's an entertainment company and a fragile streaming infrastructure and clunky front end is built to consume that entertainment. But content is king, not the technology, and it never will be."
Honestly couldn't imagine working somewhere else,2016-09-24,"Senior Software Engineer in Los Gatos, CA",5,,"Extremely competent colleagues. Fast-paced. Incredibly transparent. The culture is amazing. Benefits are amazing. Everyone here wants to do a good job. Management is being serious about diversity and it shows in their hiring. We're given incredibly autonomy to execute how we see best. I've never even heard of a company that gives individual contributors such autonomy! I bet if we decided to build a spacecraft, we could pivot and have an MVP in orbit by the end of 2017. It's also pretty neat to work for a movie studio, basically. Certainly much different than most companies in the Valley.","It's a little far down in the South Bay (Los Gatos), but there's a shuttle from SF. Deadlines can be intense and you really have to be an advocate for your time. If you're not an assertive person (or can't learn to be) then you will probably be overworked here."

Customer service representative,2019-02-22,,1,,The culture is wonderful the management make it hard to be there. There is free s snacks and plenty of training but there is zero follow through on the floor.,"The customer DOES NOT come first. “ say what you have to, get them off the phone” we literally were told to lie on a daily basis. All “soups” and their management are uneducated, therefore; all laws set into place to protect employees are completely ignored. If something is said then there will be retaliation is a huge part of the “I” which is wrong Example: no restroom break, you ask you get told no. You go anyway so you don’t get yourself “dirty” you get pulled in a conference room and talked too. - breastfeeding is a no no too, there’s no place to go and it needs to be done in a certain amount of time and at a certain time. There are things you can’t rush!! - you don’t get paid for coming in. You only get paid when you’ve gone through 4 screens to open that special window to beck It’s always slow and they get angry that we’ve clocked in late. There’s 2 choice pay the extra 3 minutes or don’t complain that were not logged in on time. - young and cute, you can do whatever you want - mature people that have amazing statistics and quality ratings aren’t recognized."
High performance company that does what it says it does,2009-08-28,"Manager in Los Gatos, CA",4,,Quality and engagement of coworkers at all levels - no dead wieght Transparency and consistency of communication Compensation and benefits,"Turnover / lack of job security / limited opportunity for advancement Netflix hires very specifically for each position. They don't want folks to move around within the company trying out different departments - they'd rather hire experts in each area. If the business changes and your role is no longer necessary, you'll leave - they won't try to slot you into something else where you're not the perfect fit, even if you've been there forever and everyone thinks you're great. They don't want to hire an Analyst and see if they can grow into a Manager role - if the role calls for a Manager, they'll hire one in the first place.  This is different and a little more stressful than other non-tech companies I've worked for. But the company is completely upfront about these policies to begin with - there are no surprises. Work hard and enjoy your perfectly qualified and committed coworkers, but keep your resume up to date."
Stay Away,2014-10-03,"Anonymous Employee in Los Gatos, CA",1,,"Good ""brand"" for your resume, I guess. Outsiders will be impressed, if only because the PR machine has been in overdrive convincing people that this is still an innovative company. But a stock price bubble does not equal innovation.","Most of the honest reviews on here (meaning those not written by HR) have already covered it, but it's a terrible place to work - a pressure-cooker environment full of overpaid but insecure bosses who manage through fear and intimidation. Crazy high turnover in every group, lots of good people getting pushed out all the time by their managers. Then those people are blamed and insulted once they're gone and unable to defend themselves. The company also stopped innovating long ago. The salary, though substantial, is not worth it, especially when you see the C-level insiders routinely cashing out millions in shares like thieves in the night. Hmmm, what do they know that everyone else doesn't? Look elsewhere - there are many other more humane, ethical, and socially rewarding places to get paid well...like Wall Street."
Fast pace and fair,2016-05-10,"Anonymous Employee in Los Gatos, CA",4,,"There are a lot of rumors about how Netflix treats its employees. The culture deck you see on the job site is real. The management team expects you to be a stellar performer, but you CAN make mistakes in the name of learning. However, if you don't learn quickly from the mistake you made, you are in trouble.  You have a lot of freedom and responsibilities to help company move forward. Things also change so quickly that what you think is true last quarter may not be a month from now. Stay ahead of the curve and be prepared to defend your opinion with data and facts.","There are some politics in the marketing department. The CMO comes from a big movie studio, so he believes in flashy commercials and campaigns. There is a constant need to prove your team's worthiness which can be mind numbing."
I wish I would've joined years ago.,2008-07-13,"Senior Software Engineer in Los Gatos, CA",5,,"Think of the people you've worked with in your career. Now imagine the 5 best of those on one team. That's what working on a team at Netflix is like. Frankly, there are no stupid people here. None. Everyone I've met is damn sharp, very sharing of their knowledge and time, and enjoys what they do.   You are treated like an adult. You are not told what to do. Netflix is laissez faire, not command and control. With that comes responsibility and the potential for failure. If you fail often enough, you will not survive. If you don't expose yourself to this risk enough, you won't survive. Some people might consider this a downside, you won't like it at Netflix if you do.  The Netflix time off/vacation policy is that there is no policy. They don't track how many hours you take. You take time off when you want to, you don't have to ask for permission or approval. This non-policy is one example of many of how thoroughly Netflix expects you to behave like an adult. I've spent many years at big name valley companies. Without exception, everyone of them claims that they treat employees like adults. All of them pale in comparison to Netflix in this regard.","I'm a developer, and the code base at Netflix has warts that demonstrate its laissez faire culture. There is no architecture group with veto power, so the code evolves organically - I personally think this is great, but it can be frustrating. Luckily, it never stays ""ugly"" for long, but it frequently feels like a ball of mud.  There seems to be quite a bit of turnover. The first month I worked here, I counted at least 5 ""good bye"" emails. At least 4 of them were not voluntary. This can be disconcerting. But this is also not a company like Cisco, with regular annual headcount reduction quotas."

Training is minimal, and the expectation is that you take educating and training yourself into your own hands, which could be a bit of a challenge to some. If you do not possess the knowledge and the talent to be a good problem solver, don't expect management to train you on solving things. -Job stability could be a concern at times - but as long as you continue to innovate, and stay professional, it shouldn't be a big concern -The packaged free lunch isn't on par with the buffets at other silicon valley software companies like Facebook and Google - but it's still free though, so can't complain much"
Freedom,2016-03-16,"Senior Software Engineer in Los Gatos, CA",5,,Freedom to choose solution path and coordinate to accomplish one's goals is something everyone has an opportunity to experience. Micro management is not in the DNA of management at Netflix.,"Choosing wrong or failing to communicate effectively can have career limiting side effects. It is true that one is given the opportunity to fail and learn from those mistakes, but it should not be taken lightly. One has a limited number of silver bullets that can be spent on mistakes."

Yet when you're not understanding something completely, instead of helping you and showing you how to do it..they lecture you and expect you to get it right. When you ask ""what is the right way to do it?"" They say there is no right way. (but there definitely is a wrong way!) If you don't get it right after the lecture they just fire you."
Culture of Fear,2017-07-05,"Senior Software Engineer in Los Gatos, CA",1,,"Pay is amazing, and kitchen is well stocked.","Hiring is a joke.

Rarely do/did we hire anyone away from a real tech company (Google, Apple, Facebook, etc).

Management is very persnickety and often unreliable. Coworkers generally help you when you have a problem because the management is standoffish.  Software engineers are fairly laughable.

"Can be fun, can be awful",2012-02-12,"in Los Gatos, CA",2,,"It was an interesting experience working at Netflix. I was lured by the supposedly high talent density, solving great customer focused problems and bringing entertainment to people around the world at an absolutely unprecedented scale. I thought that technology would be used to solve difficult problems but in the end the problems to be solved are all around content, content, content. It is fun, though, to work at Netflix. The company is extremely open and transparent with data, decisions and the overall direction of the company. There are no secrets. It is very refreshing to see such an attitude; compare that to Apple.","Yes, there are interesting things to solve in cloud computing but discovery, search, personalization, and the overall architecture of the Netflix website can only be described as patchwork. The people who are working on these services are stuck in their ways and are protecting their personal little kingdoms. Netflix used to be leading when it comes to personalization and other discovery mechanisms. It has lost its ways and now those areas are a few years behind the competition.  On a related note Netflix praises itself to have extremely talented people. This might have been the case but the talent density is certainly not the same as it used to be. A lot of the good people left recently and a lot of the deadwood hangs around because they will never be able to get a comparable salary elsewhere. There are the occasional firings going on but that is just scratching the surface. Because Netflix does not believe in career development (active or through mechanisms like 20% time) for their people it is hard to keep up with the competition."
Will fire without warning,2016-09-01,,2,,"I actually didn't mind working there, the atmosphere is great and for the most part the people are really nice. It is still a call center so of course that won't be for everybody but they try to make up for it with benefits, pay and free food and drinks while at work.","My husband and I used to work there, we both have some medical issues and were working with HR to get accommodation for that since we can't always work 40 hours a week. We had all the paperwork set up with them and had everything figured out, the paperwork was supposedly supposed to protect our jobs when we had to miss work because of that condition. Then one day they CALLED both of us, called, they waited for a day we weren't working and then called rather than bring us in in person which I thought was low, and then they fired us both on the same day saying that it was for attendance purposes and that they had given us warnings. Both my husband and I were shocked because we had been working with HR all this time and thought it had been taken care of and was going to be ok. We didn't get any warning whatsoever, every time we met with HR they would just say make sure to get the paperwork in, make sure you're here when you're supposed to or we might have to ""separate employment"", but we never got any formal warning, or anything to indicate, hey we're really close to firing you or anything like that. It just really sucked."
Supervisor,2016-10-13,"Customer Service Supervisor in Salt Lake City, UT",3,,"The job pays well, some peers are brilliant, talented, and fantastic to work with.

"Netflix! The good, the bad and the ugly!",2008-11-17,"Senior Web Engineer in Los Gatos, CA",3,,"Netflix is a place where you are surrounded by some really great minds. I wouldn't even say that SOME of the people are good while others somehow seemed to 'slip' in. If you aren't one of the best in your line of work, I don't think you'll ever get in the door here. I've been here for a number of years and have had the privilege to work with some extremely bright people. As an employee (and part of a team), its good to know that whatever you are working on is going to be top notch because of who is working on it.  Netflix also encourages you to learn and explore new technologies and expand your own knowledge base. At past companies this was always a problem. If something didn't directly relate to what you were working on... well you had to make excuses and come up with reasons why you wanted to try something new. At Netflix, they not only encourage it but really urge you to try to broaden your own skill set.  Our paid time off policy is not to be beat... Netflix has none! No two weeks a year or so many days off for personal/sick leave GARBAGE. Instead, you just tell your manager that you wanted to take three weeks off next month and he says, okay have a good time. We'll see ya when you get back! How cool is that?  Its all about Movies for me. I used to think I was a bit if a movie buff. Yeah, that was until I worked here and met real movie buff's. Meetings are filled with references to movies. In one of the team meetings I go to every week, you can count the number of Ferris Bueller's day off lines.  $$$ Show me the money. Netflix really does pay well! I left my old job doing the EXACT same thing I do here.. the only difference is, I make X2 as much!   I'd like to write more, but those reasons alone are pretty good.","When I first started, the head of HR said ""Netflix is a high performance environment."" Often, I feel like they have confused ""high pressure"" with ""high performance"", and believe me, there is a difference. Sometimes I feel like they overly eggagerate the importance of SOME features. I mean, no one is going to die on the table here guys.. its just a movie rental company.  Our medical/health benefits are mediocre at best and HR doesn't seem to care that the majority of employees are totally dissatisfied with the offerings. After constant employee complaints on how high our benefit prices are, HR comes back with even higher prices this year while having even less coverage. I'm not buying the line they fed us either ""benefits are more expensive everywhere across the country."" Whatever.. if I gave that as an excuse why I didn't get a project completed on time, I'd be ""talked to"".  Every year, we have this total JOKE of a per review process (360 reviews). You HAVE to rate your peers and get ratings back from the people you asked to rate you. From my experience, its totally pointless and a huge waste of time / energy across the company. If we spent even a quarter of the time and money it takes to run, manage, and maintain this 360 review process, we'd have double the amount of movies in our Watch Instantly offering.  Don't come here thinking you'll rise through the ranks! That just doesn't happen here. Yes, there are a few people who have started out as individual contributors and risen to the higher ranks but for the most part, I've watched very talented people leave Netflix to get management positions else where and Netflix doesn't really care. When you accept a job here, it will most likely be in the same position for the rest of your time at Netflix.  There is also a very big brother feel here.. Netflix HR is watching you. But maybe that's just me! People seem to 'disappear' sometimes!"
Great place to grow your career,2008-12-09,"Engineering Manager in Los Gatos, CA",4,,"Teamwork is highly valued in the Netflix culture, with team members even contributing to peer employee reviews.

The Truth About the Netflix Call Center..... :(,2010-06-02,"Customer Service Representative in Hillsboro, OR",1,,"-decent starting wage (assuming you make it out of training) -inexpensive benefits and decent health care coverage -for the most part, employees (CSR1) are really cool to work with -sheltered smoking area -Free Lunch (Mac and Cheese, Oatmeal, or Ramen) -Unlimited coffee (caution... don't take a bathroom break!! You may get fired) -Schedule choices offered after training (Choose Wisely) -fairly decent training support for the first two weeks of employment (if you made it)","-Out of every 100 customers who you interact with by phone, you may only have 5-6 upset customers or you risk losing your job -you are always tied to your desk by a phone cord -The calls keep coming whether you want them to or not... -There is no set concrete guidelines for evaluating personal performance. It is all subject to caller reviews (i.e. You're job may depend on somebody's bad day!!) -After your initial training (assuming you made it) there is a real lack of support for training from the management team. You will only see your team manager during your last week of training and then your first reprimand and your last day. (Watch out for the RED PACKET!!!) -Netflix is great at finding talented people to do the job, but they are HORRIBLE at retention. Do they have a quota for firing people???  -Whether you are a CSR, CSRII, Supervisor, Team Manager, or the Call Center Manager, you are never secure in this position. Do not count on it for long term stability/security in employment.   DISCLAIMER: I was not fired from my job... I quit, gave notice (albeit through the attendance line).. In all honesty, Netflix was a great transitional job for me. I needed quick money, and work and Netflix filled that vacancy. I was very happy with the people I worked with, as I made some really good friends while working there, and that is the only positive thing that came out of Netflix. I now shop the Redbox."

Experience totally based on supervisor. They have too much power,2017-01-11,,1,,"Good work, good pay. Energetic environment. New technologies.","Experience in Netflix totally depends on the supervisor. If you are lucky and get a matured manager, there is no reason to not like working in NETFLIX. However it could be a nightmare if your manager does not like you for some reason. It is always your words vs manager's word in there (happened in my case and they believe the manager). I was hired under a manager who convinced me to join Netflix (I had 24 emails from that person persuading me). However I learned after joining that I am supposed to report to a new manager and the very first day that new guy complained that I have never worked with JAVA and AWS (Then why did he agree to take me in his team in the first place ? ). Nightmare started from that very day. He kept on mentioning the same thing every one on one. He forced me to move my position in every meeting and make sure I seat where he points me to. He will talk to all my co-workers and inform them if he is cancelling one on ones, for me he wont do anything and just disappear. He  will constantly irritate me saying how good he was when he joined. He will always shout at me and try to ignore my opinions on any damn technical stuff. I was totally terrified of him and knew that he will make sure that I fail. He tried all he could. He gave me two projects and one project scope kept changing and changing. Still i tried to keep up and developed good relationships with other team managers, members and project managers.One day (I am sure my manager was waiting for that day) I wrote something incorrect in an email (this is my 4th month I guess). He pounded on me, and also after a 14 hour continuous on call, I took a 2 min break, he shouted at me for 15 minutes for missing a false alram ! I apologized. He tried to blame me for what I did not do and said he and someone else was watching me silently, while I was chatting with someone else about some technical issue over a group chat. So unethical ! He said some PM complained about me and when I asked for the names and examples he refused. I raised the alarm to higher management and they said it is ""his word vs mine"". One day they said they are sorry I had to go through this and next day they change the tone and said they have to believe my manager. I requested them to talk to engineers and get feedback. They refused to even do that. I resigned the next week as I could not take the humiliation and realized that if I stay back and work in the same group, they will find some excuse to fire me. I knew all companies where I worked before were waiting to take me back any day. So I had no worry. The funny part is the people who were working with me kept on sending me emails about how good it was to work with me and they were surprised that I left. But my manager never found anything good in me.   I wish I had a better manager in NETFLIX, then I would enjoy my life there so much. Please make sure you understand your supervisor before you join. That is the most important thing. Everything else will fall into place."

Find a better place,2011-08-11,Software Engineer,2,,Good salary (but even though u get few thousand more..it is not worth it),Interview process sucks..Reason I mention is that they take lot of pride in mentioning that if you are not star performer you may be shown the door.  My point is that if you can make good hiring process then you should not be talking about it in an interview. HR is given unreasonable super power and they try to act as super smart for no reason.  They claim to give higher salaries as opposed to other bay area companies but that amount is nothing if you really compare with other companies. I think any company which relies too much on HR for scaring candidates and keeping them in loop regarding performance of candidates is not a good company for engineers and that company is not the most coveted in bay area.  People are hard working but they are certainly not the smartest. Some are smart as in any other company so I dont understand why they create so much of hooplah.
It's got its moments...,2018-08-22,Team Leader,3,,+ Fun colleagues + Solid programs in order to identify contact drivers with + Netflix tries to engage their staff with regular fun activities outside of work. + Agents have regular 1:1's with their TL.,"- No growth opportunities for TL's. - Use their values in order to push a political agenda. If you do not work 100% conform the values, you will not have your contract extended. - Meetings go on forever. Everyone needs to have a say on a particular sort of topic without any concrete actions being taken away. - No flexibility for agents with actual valid reasons that might prevent them from working. You are expected to show up at all times."
Be prepared for abusive directors and young untrained individuals.,2019-09-20,Anonymous Employee,2,,"Salary, benefits, stock options, ownership.","Netflix as a company constantly says it is a strong advocate for diversity and inclusion, and do not tolerate “brilliant jerks”, or bullies. Unfortunately this is something that they talk about very often but when situations arises, they would often side with the individual of higher rank.   In my 2 years at Netflix, I’ve noticed that you don’t have to be the brightest and smartest person in the room to excel in this company, you just have to be the loudest, and made your presence known in meetings especially the high visibility ones.   Directors are often bullies and brilliant jerks, somethings sans brilliant - they are great at politicking and making themselves sound and look good.   The director I am working for for example, often makes me solve director level problems. When guidance is needed the answer we get very often is “not my problem”. However if the problem was successfully solved, they would be quick to claim the credit for it as the inspiration that lead the team to the breakthrough.   Netflix encourages weekly 1:1s with your cross functional partners and direct managers/directors, and encourages free sharing of ideas and respectful feedback during these sessions. My director however for example would use these sessions to threaten the staff, if too many questions were asked, they would be threatened with termination.   Another issue is Netflix loves hiring very young professionals either fresh out of school or individuals on the second job. Hiring of dynamic individuals is great, however it is essential to provide young individuals with the necessary coaching to set them up for success especially when working in a high performance environment where once needs to excel and be able to separate professional and personal feelings. No coaching is provided for these young professionally immature individuals, on top of that they pay them a lot of money that probably warrants more than 10 years of experience. What happens is that these young individuals develop an inflated ego, play politics, gossip, and take everything too personally. The lack of coaching and allowing them to run amok, results in a very apparent bullying millennial mean girls/boys culture.   HR is very aware of these problems but employees are often told that they are working on it, but nothing ever gets done. In fact, employees have stopped going to HR for any work issues, because more than often HR would side with the upper management, brand the victimized employee a “trouble employee” and eventually they will be let go. And the reason given to the entire office for their dismissal is that they are no longer excelling in their work, which most of the time is completely false. It’s almost always politics and power play involved.  I have witness this happen to many times to so many of my brilliant, hardworking and true stunning colleagues. A few of these unfortunate colleagues were also told by HR upon being let go that even though they are aware of what is happening, their hands are tied and they should just treat it as they are collateral damage.   How much you get paid also depends on who you know, and how much you know how to “charm” your bosses and the leadership team. I know of managers who are getting paid 3 x more than directors, because they are great with charming their bosses. How they determine how much each person gets paid, does not depend on experience, skill. It depends on friendships, and how well you sell yourself.   The money and benefits are great, but they also come at a very high cost. If you feel you are able to tolerate such an abusive environment, then this is the company for you."
I'd still be there if I could,2009-10-29,Administrative,5,,"I liked what Netflix calls 'Freedom and Responsibility' - you're free to make decisions - and you are responsible for them.

Netflix: seems like a great company to work for at first..,2009-05-11,Customer Service Representative,2,,Free subscription and the salary was competitive for the industry.,"Horrible hours, the constant policy changes, and lack of respect from management. The nature of the job in itself was bad, as the customer service reps are just there to be yelled at for promises that the marketing deptartment was constantly making with little thought as to how these ""features"" would actualy be implimented.  The other major issue is the lack of written rules or guidelines. The foundation of their customer service is based on the judgement of each customer service rep. The result is that there was no consistancy regarding the resolution of problems that arose. In other words a customer could get one answer from one rep and a completely different answer the next time they call and talk to a different rep. for the same problem."
"Great place to work, until you speak your mind.",2009-07-05,,3,,Most of the people are highly motivated and fun to work with. Smart group of individuals. Good at finding efficiencies,"Long Hours...

Supervisors can be let go for anything, but hourly associates once permanent employees are feared and very little is done to be rid of them. Unless you steal or do drugs, you can get away with alot."

Netflix recently turned up on the volume for english call, which caused multiple lines to sit in not stop queue since the agents also need to take care of their native language - So agents sits in back-to-back calls, switching between english and their native language. In perspective, when you get an angry/mad costumer and the call ends, their is no break what so ever, to get over the mad costumer, you just get a new call from another ""happy Netflix costumer"". After multiple conversations and meeting with supervisors - Their only comment is ""if you don't like it here at Netflix, then it is just not the right job for you"" aka they ask you to resign if you keep giving feedback or your opinion."
