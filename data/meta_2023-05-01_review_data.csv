Good place to work,2023-04-27,"Software Engineer in New York, NY",5,,"high pay, nice culture, competitive","long working hours, too many smart people"
"Open, fast, no bs",2014-03-17,"Software Development Engineer in Seattle, WA",5,,"It might be easy to roll your eyes when people from Facebook say how open their culture is, but it's true; it's more open than any other place I've worked at. At a company wide-level, secret projects, public incidents, important non-public business metrics and the like are all openly discussed. You can ask questions about them directly to Zuckerburg at the weekly Q&A. I think the idea is that if everyone is on the same page or at least, differing views are heard, the company will be stronger, and solutions may be offered from a place you didn't expect. This is much different from previous companies I worked at, where discussions on internal email lists would be shut down by some lawyer saying that there's certain things that can't be discussed, and important data is divided up to groups and individuals on a ""need to know"" basis, etc.   This culture applies at a lower level too. You feel comfortable giving feedback to each other about each other, about product decisions, about management, etc. The flipside of this openness is that you of course, have to be willing to receive the feedback, you have to recognize that while openness and feedback is highly encouraged, decisions have to get made, and actions and data are more valuable than words. At the higher level, since the company trusts employees with access to so much information, keeping such info confidential from the outside world is taken seriously.  It's a great place to work as an engineer. You're given a lot of freedom, but it's also a responsibility to make sure you're doing things that are valuable. You don't get much credit for working hard or being smart if you don't produce valuable output.  One cool thing about Facebook, in contrast to other comparable companies (Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, though in truth, FB is much smaller), is how they have a pretty singular focus. Even with the differing areas (including advertising and such), they do a good job of keeping their eye on their mission of connecting as many people as possible. I also think they are way more empathetic to their users than most people give them credit for. It seems like popular opinion has it that FB is arrogant and only cares about its users insomuch as they represent $-signs. From within the company, it didn't feel this way at all. I saw a lot of empathy towards users, and a lot effort spent to improve or things or fix broken things with no direct financial benefit. The strategy is not complex. The thinking is that if they can make FB easier and more fun to use, then more people will use it for more time each day (which will also have a network effect of attracting even more people to use it), then the advertising dollars will follow. Of course, it is true that FB wants to make the audience more accessible to advertisers as well, but there are a lot of people at FB who care about privacy and security.  They have really good infrastructure and really great ways to share the infrastructure and code. They have a lot of cool internal tools, and what they've built is really impressive, and more importantly, it helps your team build products faster without having to solve problems that someone else already solved. Every software company tries to do this, but FB seems to have been more successful with it. Perhaps it's because they're still relatively small, but if anything, I can at least say it is very cool while it lasts.  The perks and work environment are great, unless you're one of those types that can't stand open office spaces. I've worked in both a private office and open offices in multiple companies. While I do think a private office has some benefits, I mostly think it's a personal luxury for the employee and a huge waste of money for the company. I'd much rather have the money go into other areas like salary, benefits, and other workplace improvements rather than the added real estate necessary to have offices.  Of course, you've heard about the food and snacks. They have an amazing selection of great stuff, and what I like about it is that it sort of goes above and beyond expectations. Sure, some days, lunch is better than others, but I really can't complain, and the selection of drinks and snacks is amazing. It's not like you should work at FB just because of that, but it demonstrates FB's desire to make work as fun and convenient as possible.  You'll be surrounded by people who like being there. I can't think of a better environment to work in. If you have a giant ego, you may not like it as much. Respect is definitely given to those that have deep experience in the industry, and they are expected to lead others and mentor more junior employees. However, if for whatever reason, you can't perform at the level expected, no one is going to care if you did this and that at Google or shipped ten things at MS, etc.  FB also has a lot of fun events, and I made a lot of friends working there, so going to the events was fun. Also, if you're older and worried that FB is just a bunch of 22-year-olds, and that you won't fit in, I wouldn't worry about that. FB does have a lot of young employees (who are really smart btw), and it does hire a lot of people straight out of college, but it also attracts a lot of experienced engineers from other top companies like Google, MS, Amazon, etc.  Work-life-balance seemed totally normal to me. It may be different depending on your team, but I felt you could do 40-50 hours of work a week for the most part and you would be totally fine. It's about what you produce, not how hard you're working. Other team members who had children would work normal hours and go home at normal times. I didn't see any of these folks have a problem when they left early to take care of their child or things like that. Of course, there could be times that people are expected to work extra if something critical happens, but for the most part everyone wants to avoid this and this happens sparingly, from what I observed. Now, there were many times where I chose to work late myself, but I never felt any pressure to do so. The caveat is that there are on-call rotations, and in addition, even if you are not on-call, you are expected to be reasonably available if the on-call person needs your help. However, again, no one wants this, and your team will work on ways to avoid these situations.  The best thing I can say is that working at FB is about productivity. I didn't experience and political bs and it was a pleasure working with a group of people who were all concerned with producing a good product and making the best of the time spent while doing it.","FB expects a lot out of engineers, and you can't slack off. Of course, you shouldn't slack off at any job, but since FB is pretty fast-paced, there is a risk that you'll have trouble adjusting at first.  FB has a lot of custom infrastructure and tools, and prehaps more impressively, it works great. It makes doing your job really great, but on the other hand, you'll end up learning a lot of stuff that won't be applicable elsewhere.  FB's code-base is very good in some ways, but in other ways, it's not as great as some of the existing engineers think it is. I don't think this is that big of a deal, but the important part is that as an engineer, you need to quickly learn FB's values and practices and ""get with the program"" so to speak. If you don't like some things, then you just have to deal with it, as it's not likely you're going to change people's minds at this point. The nice thing is that things are at least very consistent."
"Fast paced company with high expectations, but incredibly fair. You won't a place that cares more about it's people.",2017-02-16,"Anonymous Employee in Menlo Park, CA",5,,- Incredible benefits  - Excellent compensation that rewards strong performance  - Lots of autonomy  - Tons of room for growth - Very transparent from the top down - Strong leadership - Intelligent and caring colleagues - The most fair and well thought out review process you will find everywhere  - Exciting work,"- If you don't learn to make the work life balance work for you, it can be exhausting. But you'll also be given lots of support with this if you ask for it.  - It doesn't matter how good you are at your job, chances are you're going to be surrounded by a ton of other people who are just as good if not better. Imposter syndrome is real, but if you got an offer, you probably belong here too."
Pleasantly Surprised,2016-02-16,"Site Selection Program Manager in Menlo Park, CA",5,,"I'm a 55 year old working in a company where the average age is 28, and I've never been happier. I have always wanted to work in a company where I wasn't the proverbial square peg, and after nearly 30 years in the work force, I believe that I have found the company that complements my ideology for how a company should operate. Here are the ""Pros"" as I see them...  - Leadership: Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, Chris Cox and the rest of the leadership team. Inspiring, smart and totally real. - The Culture: The openness is a real thing, we're trusted to do the right thing, mistakes are expected, being yourself is important and encouraged, humility is encouraged and expected, building trust is paramount, the mission of making the world a more open and connected place isn't just a cool phrase because it guides everything. It's not about us, it's about everyone else. - The People: Smart and nice is what I find. The diversity is better than any other company I've worked at and it's getting better. Those that are figuring out how to make what we do better for everyone are really good at implementing their ideas. Two years ago I didn't know what this company really was or if it had a secure future. I can clearly see now that they have what it takes to last, and it's sincere. - Management: Managers are hired because they're good managers and not because they're good at something else. The management track is different than the contributor track and they're equal in importance. - Benefits: Working in the Valley it's hard to differentiate all the benefits employees receive and Facebook is at least equal to all the major tech companies, but coming from Seattle the benefits are nothing short of incredible.  Granted, I haven't been with the company for very long and I'm still in the honeymoon period, but I can tell what's real and what's not; this place is for real.","Like any tech company, the work is big and complicated so work/life balance can suffer from time to time. The difference is that it's the passion within the individuals that drives them to work long hours and forego time off. Of course there can be times when schedule demands force the imbalance, but it's not such that 10-12 hours days become commonplace and expected regardless. We do what we do to get the job done; no one is killing themselves because there's an order to do so.  Being able to eat to your hearts/stomachs content can be dangerous to the waistline, but that's a self-control thing and not the company's issue."
Welcome to The Hunger Games,2023-04-26,"Senior Product Manager in Menlo Park, CA",2,,"Meta is a prestigious employer and looks great on your resume. The people I worked with at Meta are by far the most intelligent people I've ever worked with in my entire life. In addition to being work smart, they also share a high degree of emotional intelligence. Conflicts are handled with grace and respect. I've never seen people yelling at each other or becoming defensive when offered feedback. Meta has forever changed the way I work and I will be forever grateful.","What Mark Zuckerberg is doing with layoffs and cost savings has completely decimated morale. Everyone is anxious and everyone is for himself. The company I joined talked about diversity, inclusion and 'Meta, Metamates, Me"". There is no sign of Metamates anywhere now. It's the Hunger Games where executives are tone deaf and don't acknowledge the panic they've set off, and employees are trying to outlive each other by backstabbing, plotting, hording information and other underhanded tactics. As cost cutting set in, the food became awful and the perks were no longer competitive. There is also no intelligible vision for the future of the company and instead the company is either chasing near-term Ads and Reels metrics or spending tons of cash on pipe dreams, like the Metaverse and questionable AI initiatives."
Former Recruiter (Impacted by Lay Offs),2023-04-10,"Recruiter in Austin, TX",4,,"As part of the onboarding process we are given a robust 4-6 week training schedule alongside new talent acquisition hires to understand the intricacies of recruiting. I cannot recommend enough how informative and useful these trainings were to understand Meta's unique applicant tracking system and the various tools in use to facilitate the search and candidate management process. In addition to the onboarding process there is also a period of ~6 months where all new hires have an onboarding buddy, either on the team or who works adjacent to, in helping new hires ask questions as unique circumstances arise. The are resource galore at Meta, and they have their own unique Wiki page to find any information you may need. It's broken down for general employee usage as well as function specific - in short, what one role function can see, is not the same information someone out of that role can see. Unlike other large corporations that have a more strict policy & procedure in place, Meta allows you to cross-collaborate across regions, teams and functions to see a task or project to completion. There is much more visibility and agency into owning your work.","The company could benefit with having additional HR support. The Peeps Team (HR) notoriously are backlogged with information requests and tickets due to understaffing, and there were instances during my time where I had no way to verify questions for talent (information beyond what my leadership was able to assist with), and sometimes it would take 3+ weeks to receive any feedback from the team."
Wanted to love it,2023-03-10,"Production Engineer in Bellevue, WA",2,,"* salary/perks/401k contributions  * A lot of really smart people to learn from and grow your skills. Well-seasoned ""engineers at heart"".  * Access to incredible scale (of systems) not present outside of FAANG * If you get lucky, you'll get a good manager who has your back and maintains integrity and helps you grow. If you're even luckier, you'll get into a functional team with reasonable expectations.","* lots of toxic senior people and management that will use any excuse to cut you down and lie to your face repeatedly without consequences  * Lots of insufferable politics that leave services in a terrible state and the team ends up with really high turnover rate because no one wants to stay * Extreme, constant, and unnecessary pressure to ""perform"" that may leave you with poor mental and physical health.  * If there's no metrics to back anything you've invested effort into in order to do it right/better for the long term, it didn't happen and it doesn't matter.  * Be prepared to constantly defend your entire existence and worth, especially if you're an early-career engineer. There's no trust in engineers, only engineers who become at least part-time politicians. Be prepared to become a blogger so you can advertise everything you're doing to people who don't care by posting to internal groups so that it looks good in front of management and is easier to ""sell"" during performance evaluations. An introvert's nightmare.  * There's no ""bottom-up"" culture anymore, you do what you're told, or else."
People Focused,2020-05-24,"Engineering Manager in San Francisco, CA",5,,"Facebook deeply cares about its employees and has built a compelling culture around support and growth. Career growth opportunities are plentiful. If you don't like the team you're on or don't get the support you want from your manger, Facebook empowers you to find new teams or projects. Facebook wants its employees to be invested in their work and to feel connected to its larger mission. If large scale opportunities and growth are important to you, Facebook is a fantastic place to work.",Facebook's culture is demanding and fast paced. The greatest aspect of working at Facebook is that everyone is very motivated and very smart. The problem with this is that they all expect the very same of you. Holding a very high bar for excellence can certainly be demanding so it's important to make sure you're always carefully paying attention to your own personal work/life balance.
Best company I have a worked at,2023-03-26,"Software Engineer in Menlo Park, CA",5,,"If you are an engineer who loves autonomy and is self-driven, this is the place for you. This company is entirely run by engineers and managers play a supporting role. I've never had so much freedom to work on things I loved, try out new experimental approach without worrying about failure. My team members provide honest and direct feedback and help me be as successful as I can. Only results are rewards, failure is definitely not punished. This is definitely not one of those places where you can coast by not taking any risks. I have had several different managers and they have been extremely invested in my growth and constantly work on my promotions without me asking for it. The company takes fairness to a whole new level and ensures pay increases and stock refreshers are all formulaic. I have worked at several companies and Meta has been the fairest and also the place I have grown the most as an engineer.","Some orgs are bloated and there are definitely pockets of Meta where culture is not great. But I'd like to believe they are a small minority. Transparency from leadership has been decreasing over time, which is expected as the company grows in size. I think the social-media only approach of the company may not be right. The company has incredible products that aren't social in any way but the company won't launch to the public because they aren't social."

There has been no accountability for mistake that lead to the 11/22 lay-offs, and the “year of efficiency” in 2023 has, so far, been a farce as very little work is getting done."

Unlike SWE, who can prove their impacts by finishing pre-planned coding projects and rolling out pre-planned features, data scientist does not automatically get credit if you only finish beautiful analyses. You have to suggest eng team to apply your suggestion from analysis, and prove how much of the product growth are from your analysis. So sometimes your impact can be subjective.  - Skillset. You may be asked to do a lot of ad-hoc analyses from eng team, which I am sure are very important and can guide engineers whether to implement certain features, but that will prevent you from doing some deep dive analyses and learning some new techniques in data analysis. Maybe after a year or two, you will find that you did not build any statistical models or haven't touched any machine learning. But that's the skillset what other companies will ask for when you apply new job. Who cares you did how many ad-hoc analyses or AB test or wrote how many data pipelines. It's the fancy machine learning model that will earn you respect.  Also, total pay is lower than SWE for the same level."

Amazing for female engineers,2017-05-03,"Software Engineer in Menlo Park, CA",5,,"I'm a software engineer who has been at Facebook for almost a year. It is hands down the best place I have ever worked.  To be frank, I didn't have high expectations going in that it would be very different from the misogynistic cultures I've had to navigate at previous companies.   Before working at Facebook, I'd kind of come to accept that being a female engineer would always be a somewhat isolating existence and the best I could do would be to find a team with 90% great colleagues and just try and avoid the creepy and rude ones as much as possible. I'd seen that as long as they performed well (or held some other utilitarian value for the company) they would always have a place in a company and their treatment of women would be an open secret and accepted.  Honestly, my first couple months at Facebook made me aware of how much effort I'd been spending navigating those types of situations.  It's incredible working with people who assume your competence rather than constantly having to battle to prove yourself.  It's amazing seeing constant efforts towards dissecting internalized biases and senior male employees openly discussing their efforts to catch themselves unconsciously interrupting people. It's laughable to try to imagine this happening at my previous companies.  It's so precious being able to find a place where you can just focus on your work.",It's a long commute for San Franciscans who come down to Menlo Park because we don't have an SF office yet.

Software Engineers of the Enterprise World,2020-02-20,"Enterprise Engineer in Austin, TX",5,,"- Working on high impact projects which are challenging and meaningful - More flexibility with office locations than traditional SWE roles (e.g. there's EE teams in Austin but no SWE teams) - Hard to imagine a better place to learn and grow as an engineer - A lot of EE teams are continuously finishing projects and beginning new ones, so you can have a lot more variety in what you're working on (which makes it much easier in my opinion to choose projects which you find interesting or you want to learn more about)","- Hard to switch from EE teams to SWE teams (requires re-interviewing) if you're in one of the big Engineering offices - Since traditional EE roles dealt more with things like Oracle development, you can get the feeling that EE is looked down on by SWE orgs. I think this is changing quickly as the role evolves and people realize the complex problems EE's are solving, but we're not there yet in terms of having the same 'prestige' as SWEs - Deadlines can be tight depending on business needs - It's on you to determine how much you want to work. This is a double edged sword because you can work a ton in order to drive quicker promotions, but also have to be proactive on forcing work/life balance as there's always more work you could be doing."

Not as good as you might like it to be,2015-04-07,"Marketing/Sales in Menlo Park, CA",3,,"Amazing place in so many ways. Benefits and perks are literally the best you can possibly ask for. Caliber of people is amazing as well, in fact it is a little scary and intimidating. If you like fast paced, this is the place for you as the product (Facebook) can change overnight.","WAY to many layers of management and career path is not clear. The culture is also sink or swim which given the caliber of person they bring in and how many people they have to pick from, is crazy. why would you bring in that level of talent and then let her/him flounder? The young, cocky culture makes for a political one. Engineering rules the roost and sales teams are made up of people so young and inexperienced it is laughable."
"Not for everyone, hypocracy and blame I saw mostly",2015-10-21,"Manager, Specific Contract Services in Mountain View, CA",2,,"Lovely campus, okay perks for contract workers.","The HR/training teams that I worked with were staffed by people that thougt they were experts. They indicated that no contractors could ever offer value; contractors were viewed as an extra pair of hands. However, my role was specifically to provide expertise and coaching in my domain area. The junior/mid-level staff never solicited feedback and assumed only their ideas were useful. Just because people say they are open to feedback does not make it so. I got unsolicited feedback constantly at FB: everyone has an opinion and thinks it's valuable. But, not once did anyone ever ask for my feedback. In that sense, and many others, it's a hypocritical environment.   If you're junior or less than 15 years in your job, FB is probably a good place to grow. If you're more experienced, be sure you carefully evaluate the job. My experience is that I wasn't working with the best or brightest, more often they were the narrow-minded, arrogant and entitled.  Finally, in the area I worked, it was all about blame and pointing fingers when things went wrong. And because they hate processes, of course things would go wrong."
"Fast pace, flat culture, great people",2019-10-23,"Software Engineer in Menlo Park, CA",5,,"FB-unique pros: - Super flat culture. Weekly Q&As with execs that are really open and casual, purposeful de-emphasis on titles. The emphasis is on ideas and impact; aspiring meritocracy - Fast pace! Some view this as a con, but if you are high-energy and easily bored like me, this is ideal. Plus, this includes fast career growth. If you can perform, you will be rewarded quickly. - Great people! ""Brilliant jerk"" behavior, as seen in these kinds of companies, is generally less tolerated/prevalent here than elsewhere - Generally best engineering pay among big-tech employers   Less unique pros you've probably heard of (still awesome): - Top-class benefits (including INSANE parental benefits) - Amazing tech infrastructure, a great place to go very tech-deep - Campus is basically Disneyland","- Recent newsmedia. It's easy to either feel discouraged or develop a bit of an ""us versus them"" mentality when the media/public seem both technically ill-informed and antagonistic towards your company. - It's an increasingly mature company, which means the pace is (slowly) slowing down.

A mature culture of smart people working on the hardest and most rewarding problems,2012-11-19,"Software Engineer in Menlo Park, CA",5,,"The Culture: This tops the list of reasons to work at Facebook. Many companies say they take their culture seriously but Facebook lives it. The mantras and propaganda around the office really do help you ""stay focused and keep shipping"", by clearing away your own barriers and resolving debates.  The Impact: My first day on the job I submitted a diff that now hundreds of millions of people see every day. Imagining a more connected world keeps me coming in every day, because I know that I'm building that future.  The Career Opportunities: There is no arbitrary ladder, no game mechanics, at Facebook. Your career grows as you hack larger things. Because you are encouraged to work across Facebook, jumping teams and technologies, you gain a variety of skills that keeps you agile and flexible. And because Facebook is built on a lot of open source technologies, the skills you gain here are easily transferable everywhere.","Work / Life balance: If you want to spend most of your time with your family, and work is just a job to you look elsewhere. No one keeps track of your time, but if you want to do well here you'll spend a lot of your free time thinking about the problems you're tackling."
A heaven for an engineer!,2014-02-23,"Software Engineer in Palo Alto, CA",5,,"I moved here from a larger stable company where I was also working as a software engineer, and I have just been wow-ed! Apart from the amazing perks, I work with a set of very dedicated, determined and intelligent folks, which is really the best part of working here.  - Co-workers are mostly rockstars! - Lots of resources to learn - 7 months into my job and I feel I am already a much better engineer. - Lots of importance on what YOU want to work on, versus what your manager thinks you should work on. You can freely talk to your manager and find an intersection between your interests and the company/product needs. - Everything is automated (again by rockstar teams), and processes are made as simple as possible. - Great pay, stocks and bonuses. - Amazing perks! Lots of food choices, great campus, regular team happy hours with great food, and the list goes on and on.",- Work-life balance almost 0 on weekdays! I spend the entire day working/thinking about work. But that is what I was looking for. Weekends are upto you - most people do not work. - Lots of process changes in short periods of time - so you are constantly climbing the learning curve.

We get breakfast, lunch, snack, and dinner served up by the best chefs around. Menus change daily and my favorite to date has been the Willy Wonka themed lunch menu. Sushi day is legit too. * Flexible work schedules. 9 to 5 is dead, work the times that best work for you and your job. * Fun (Game Day, random toga party, RipStiks, cool people, etc.)",There's some growing pains because of the fast company growth and the office can get a bit noisy at times. My last job was at Google and I have to say that facebook is a far better place to work.
Great place to be an engineer,2012-11-13,"Senior Software Engineer in Saint Louis, MO",5,,"- Almost unbelievable autonomy and trust given to engineers; most projects bottom-up vs. top-down - Big, interesting projects are everywhere; if someone is bored at work, they're not trying very hard - Caliber of peers is extremely high - For the most part, rapid adoption (and often creation, e.g. a VM for PHP) of new technologies","- Many (though not all) engineers tend to work lots of hours, mostly because they just enjoy what they're doing. If this isn't necessarily your lifestyle, you may feel like you're not ""keeping up"". This is really all in the eye of the beholder, though, as there are many engineers who are very effective and productive and use that to work more limited hours so that they can enjoy family/non-work activities. - Most teams have rotating on-call rotations, wherein the engineer must be available to be paged 24h a day (typically for a period of a week) to respond to issues with their product or service. This is more of a burden for some teams than others (e.g. a core piece of infrastructure vs. a little-used feature). This isn't particularly fun. - Rapid pace of product change means it can be a challenging place to be in infrastructure. This isn't necessarily bad, but it does require a flexibility in planning and mindset, particularly if you come from a company where software releases are measured in months-years."
Heaven on earth,2020-03-29,"Quantitative Researcher in Menlo Park, CA",5,,"State of the art campus with onsite gyms, spa, hair salon, arcade and more. Outstanding internal tools, both software and hardware, for work and collaboration with colleagues around the world. Top of market pay, even before you count the benefits. Free food is just the beginning. Probably the most underrated perk is a free cell phone with international data roaming. (It's a corporate phone, but personal use is allowed within reasonable limits.)  Promotion cycles are twice yearly, more frequent than some other tech companies. Promotions come quick to top performers, who are lavished with ""refresher"" or ""additional"" equity awards.","Exhausting performance review process. It feels neverending. Performance ratings are a bit too formulaic, and thus can be gamed to an extent; the system undervalues certain types of work (for example long-term, risky projects) that other companies would find valuable.  Traffic around the Menlo Park (MPK) HQ is atrocious. Parking is extremely constrained. Corporate shuttles are reliable and the route network covers a huge amount of the Bay Area and then some (there's even several daily shuttles to Santa Cruz) -- but the seats are often too narrow and uncomfortable. To give you a sense of the problem, most economy class airline seats are wider and more plush!"
intern,2020-08-04,"Intern in Palo Alto, CA",5,,great fun have free time,busy and kind of stressful
Getting Corporate,2015-06-17,"Data Scientist in Menlo Park, CA",3,,- Food - Health care benefits - Fringe benefits - Nice campus - Corporate shuttles - State of the art tech stack - Extremely smart coworkers - Visionary and bold top management,"Work/life balance can get hurt as a lot of folks at the office are single and do not understand the needs of having a family.  The company is getting bigger. This means more room for backroom politics and aligning people without ruffling people's feathers.  Very talented individual contributors (and/or good at politics) are being promoted. As a result, instead of having well rounded managers, you end up having either extremely career driven or super awkward managers. Some of those middle managers are very green, making it even more painful.  Some women feel like they have to be extra tough at work because of the Leanin coolaid, making them very hard to work with."
"Great perks, but limited growth opportunities",2017-05-18,"Software Engineer in Menlo Park, CA",5,,"From the moment you walk in the door, it is very evident the company goes to great lengths to make you feel welcome and cared for. From a slew of on-campus food choices, to a gym, and a Disney-like feel to the campus, the place really pushes the bar to what working at a company feels like on the surface.","After being with Facebook for some time, the not-so pretty things come to light. They have very aggressive rules for tenure, where you are expected to be promoted or asked to leave the company. Performance reviews at Facebook feel like they are pushing a one-size-fits all model, where they literally represent you as a post-it note on a whiteboard for managers to place on a bell curve against your fellow employees according to how they feel you performed."
"Sometimes good, sometimes a bad place to work.",2014-01-14,"SCO-Infrastructure in Menlo Park, CA",3,,"Benefits, perks and pay are good. Most people are very nice.","Facebook could have been a great place to work, had it not been for the management in certain departments. When half of the people in your group quit, because they couldn't work for the new management, there is a problem. Yet upper management seemed to not notice this.   There is no work/life balance at Facebook. Good luck getting time off, as you don't have time to leave your desk to take a vacation or have a day off, and don't have backups to support you, so if you do get a day off, your desk is piled with the work that didn't get done when you were gone."
Best workplace if you really want to get things done!,2014-08-17,"Software Engineer in Menlo Park, CA",5,,"- You are measured and rewarded on impact and not the other usual factors such as your relationship with manager or how many hours you have to work - Great open culture where you can question anything and anyone. You are encouraged to take risks in order to achieve something bigger. - Great place for mentorship - bootcamp is amazing way to understand company culture, build relationships and get exposure to various technologies. Beyond that there are tons of individuals that you just need to ask and they will help you in every way possible. - Facebook has some of the friendliest individuals that I have ever worked with - Great perks! food, amenities, health, dental, gym, and the list goes on and on - Believes in compensating you what you are worth instead of trying to lowball and counter offering once you have a competing offer. - You are truly working on things that are making a difference in people's lives","- If you really want to set yourself apart, know that you are probably working with some of the brightest in the industry. You better be on top of your game :-)"

Everyone is friends here, we work hard, but also have a great time and love coming to work every day. We get free gourmet breakfast, lunch and dinner daily from an amazing culinary team. We play basketball every week, have free beer on Friday and get to ripstick around the office. We even have games rooms and a ping pong table! The people who work here are incredibly high caliber individuals. The recruiting process is tough!","Some of the younger folks here (and there are many) have never worked anywhere else and they have no idea how good the place is. This often leads to a sense of entitlement which would never fly at another Company. Having said that, we all benefit from the extra perks that get put in place. Philz Coffee!!"
The most intense and rewarding experience of my career.,2012-03-26,"in Menlo Park, CA",5,,"Access to people who are smart in ways that you can't even comprehend.  Incredibly challenging work, and opportunities to finally do things you've wanted to do elsewhere but couldn't because of the size or political currents of other companies. You really care passionately about making the world more open and connected and want to be surrounded by people who are dedicated fully to making that happen. You want to work with people who not only help you experience all of the above but who are also the most respectful and inclusive people you've ever met. When we say we want you to be yourself completely at work - we really mean it.","The pace and scale of what we're doing is insane. You're regularly exhausted but in a good way. Facebook isn't just a company, it's a kind of movement that people dedicate themselves to in ways that transcend the traditional bounds of employment. You will make life-long friends who will become a part of your life beyond 9-5."
Awesome Company/ Great Employees,2017-04-25,"Anonymous Employee in Seattle, WA",5,,"Aside from the countless perks that are literally too long to list out here, one of the best things about this company is it's people. Everyone goes above and beyond to help each other to succeed. It truly is a team effort.   Upon arriving to the office every morning, everyone from the reception staff to your team says hello to you, and genuinely is interested in your life. People love coming to work every morning and are excited about what they do here every day, and it shows.   Many companies as competitive as this expect a lot from their employees, and so does Facebook. However, they also encourage a healthy work/ life balance, ensuring their employees are taking enough time off (either by working reasonable hours every day, and/or actually using all of their PTO) to be able to stay fresh and ready to work when at work.","Not many cons to the company. It is a large company, so I guess the biggest con would be you are not going to know everyone at the company. But with how friendly people are, you will make friends in no time!"
Great people moving fast.,2013-10-03,"Software Engineer in Menlo Park, CA",5,,"Probably the most important thing about Facebook is the culture. Engineers are always free to solve problems when they see them. Generally there are no hard deadlines to meet, so you can almost always put something to the side when you think there's something more valuable to do. If you find a bug in somebody else's project, fix it. If you have an idea for a useful feature, make it. We're willing to try anything once. The agility of Facebook is amazing, because all engineers are expected to be able to help out with anything. The org is very loose.  And the benefits are fantastic. Free food, laundry, shuttle service from all over the Bay Area, and much more.","I frequently take a moment to consider what I would want to improve at Facebook, and I never come up with anything. I could see how if you were somebody who really needed structure and direction, you could get frustrated. Facebook strongly encourages engineers to try working on new things every so often so that you're always learning, and also expects autonomy."
Amazing place to work,2012-11-17,"Software Engineer in Menlo Park, CA",5,,"- Huge impact from day one - I got to own pretty large projects almost as soon as I joined, and the amount of trust placed in employees even from the first few weeks in bootcamp is amazing.  - Exciting work environment, I work with some of the very best people I've met in the business every day - Real start-up feel and anxious to keep it that way. There's a lot of attention paid to the culture of the company - Things really do move fast. It's really motivating to see the results of your efforts get adopted so quickly - Great support from management - Fun @ work, many great perks. Lots of free food, and a gym to work it all off.",High workload mean that you have to be pretty motivated to enjoy it. On the flip side that's mostly self-driven - I certainly end up working a lot not because I'm pushed to but because I want to see my project succeed.
Young Adult Wonderland w/ Golden Children,2015-09-23,"Marketing in Menlo Park, CA",5,,"- Incredibly transparent when it comes to company priorities and initiatives - Great access to leaders in the company. Nobody is too big to talk to. - Touches basically all of internet-connect humanity, which is nice. - Playing on the largest-scale chess board in the world against the top 4-5 tech companies","- Lots of hiring from outside that layer long-term employees under several managers - There are a few ""Golden Children"" inside the company who can essentially do no wrong and will always be given control of the most interesting/valuable projects. They are either buddies with Zuck/Sheryl or were actual startup veterans who were brought in from the outside. Either way, it's near impossible to become a significant player in the company without that ""golden"" anointment."
Product Manager,2016-02-08,"Product Manager in Menlo Park, CA",5,,"Freedom to explore, speaking to my counterparts at other companies like Google, Twitter, and Uber it seems that Facebook has some of the most open cultures that encourages product exploration outside of one's primary duties and helping people finding impact across the company in places of their personal interest.","Commute to San Francisco. The commute to San Francisco is unhealthy and inhibits social life. I want to live the city lifestyle, and this is a serious consideration for me. My next job will certainly not involve 3 hours of commuting each day."
Facebook,2017-12-05,"IOS Recruiter in Seattle, WA",5,,"I've been at Facebook for about a year and a half and it is the first company i've worked for that's truly walked the walk in terms of standing by it's mission and values. The people that I work with care deeply about their users and about the company as a whole and Facebook cares deeply and invests in those employees as well. The problems are large scale and complex, but the people working to solve them are the best of the best. I come to work everyday and enjoy my job, I feel appreciated, secure in my role, and that I personally make an impact every day. It's a rare feeling.  Perks are insane, benefits are humbling and the people I work with are smart, funny and dynamic. Can't recommend the company enough.",No large cons that come to mind.
Great company with a bright future,2017-01-13,"Anonymous Employee in Seattle, WA",5,,"Hands-down the smartest people I've worked for in my career Great open culture. People are driven by team and company success, not personal ego. Pay well-above industry standard, for every job in the company.","There is one little *thing*  Some devs came up with a lottery program. Once a year it generates a bunch of random numbers and assigns one to each person in the company. Then of that list of numbers it generated, it randomly selects one. Whoever that number is assigned to is the lottery ""winner"". The winner is then taken to a private, sound-proof room where they are chained to a wall and then are beaten to death with a tire iron by Mark Zuckerberg while he screams ""LOTTERY In June STOCKS BE HEAVY SOON!!! MUHaHAHAHAHA!!!!"""
Really the best engineering experience I have hoped for,2012-08-29,"Software Engineer in Menlo Park, CA",5,,"During the 5+ years I've worked here as an engineer, I've had really incredible and satisfying experiences. I've learned so much more than I did at my past company in a similar amount of time, have almost never been disappointed with the caliber of a co-worker (and I've worked somewhat closely with around 50 other engineers) and have gotten to contribute the product as a clip I wouldn't have believed possible. As an engineer I felt like I had a lot of control and influence over my work and the products I worked on and got to create some of the most impactful and satisfying products and features of my career, past and probably future. If you're really great at what you do or have really great product ideas, very little will interfere with you showing that quickly. New engineers are highly valued in the culture.  Salary/bonus compensation has been really strong in addition to the stock compensation.","I've felt like I've been able to maintain a pretty good work life/balance (especially after the first year), but I feel like I had to work hard to make that happen. Being around many people who feel compelled to put most of their waking weekday hours into coding can be intimidating, even when you feel confident in the job you're doing and even when pressure to put in a ton of hours is rarely explicit. Engineers can definitely work reasonable hours, especially older ones with families, but you have to bring your own self-confidence to trust that you're kicking butt even if you're not putting in a ton of hours (especially during the summers when interns ratchet up the intensity around the office)  Things are done very fast, which also means things can be hectic and sometimes chaotic (though this feels less and less true as the years go by), but I'd expect some culture shock for anyone coming from software companies where stability and consensus are top-priorities. Code quality has felt really good for the past 2 or so years, though this definitely didn't feel true when I started."
Come here if you want to make an impact.,2012-11-13,"Recruiter in Menlo Park, CA",5,,"I joined facebook coming from 8 years in the Financial Services industry. Wow, what a world of difference. 2 biggest pros come to mind:  - Openness. Do you have an issue with a colleague or something facebook is doing? No problem. Take care of it. Facebook encourages its employees to be open and give feedback for things they think should be improved.  - Do you want to see your impact on 1 billion users? Come to facebook. Although I'm not in engineering, I work with a lot of software engineers, including interns, who constantly talk about the things they work on and how they love showing these off to their friends and family.","- Being 7 months new, I am still in the process of thinking of areas of improvement."
"Smart, conscientious coworkers and an employer that treats us well",2012-11-13,"Data Scientist in Menlo Park, CA",5,,"My coworkers are ridiculously smart and competent. Every day I learn something new from one of them. We move fast and think about having impact on the world. Our site is used by a billion people. The company cares about its employees' quality of life; we have excellent food, shuttles to/from San Francisco, a culture that eschews meetings, great ergonomics, onsite medical care, and a gym. New engineers go through ""bootcamp,"" which exposes you to all aspects of the codebase in a friendly environment where you're allowed to ask n00bish questions and bond with other new engineers.","It's difficult to come up with meaningful downsides to working here. We move very fast, so I don't always have time to be a perfectionist (but in general that's a good thing). Our codebase is huge and it can be difficult to find documentation."
Rarely a dull moment,2012-11-14,"Software Engineer in Menlo Park, CA",4,,"- Pervasive focus on impact. - Plenty of opportunity to make an impact, as we ship to millions of users on a short cycle with very little red tape. Not afraid to make mistakes, though of course we strongly prefer to avoid them. - Strong overall compensation. - Excellent on-site food options. I eat here at every opportunity. - Fun ""work hard play hard"" internal culture. Coworkers tend to be ""from the Internet"". Many lolz are had.","- Now eating too many sweets because they're readily available. - Sometimes feel like I joined too late (e.g., hear Proposition 30 complaints from coworkers, doesn't apply to me). - Continued growth has decreased the small company feel somewhat. Beginning to develop internal politics. - There is some tendency among some folks to prefer a quick hack instead of the Right Thing in the name of moving fast."
Continuous Improvement,2016-02-15,"Software Engineer in Menlo Park, CA",5,,"I've been at Facebook for more than six years. The culture is very introspective and dedicated to self-improvement; if it were the same company it had been in 2009, I wouldn't still be there. Everytime I think I might leave, a new awesome project comes up that keeps me around. Seeing Mark Zuckerberg mature into the great leader he is has been magical, and I have a lot of trust in Sheryl and Mark and Mike Schroepfer to make good decisions.  In many ways, engineers are more productive now than they were in 2009, despite the fact that we work at a big company now. We have more tools, resources, and knowledgeable people at our disposal, which compensates to some degree for the increased bureaucracy you see in some parts of the company. We also launch to hundreds-of-millions-to-billions of users, depending on the product, making our contributions very high-value. Product launches continue to be driven by bottom-up ideas as much as top-down directives. That doesn't mean that you personally are going to have an idea which shakes the world, but it does mean that you have a better shot than other companies. Especially if you're an infrastructure engineer, the culture is very bottom-up. You still have great latitude to come up with execute your own ideas. The flipside of this coin is that if you're not good at deciding what to work on, you'll need to learn that skill within a year or so; management isn't going to spoonfeed you tasks to the extent they do at other large companies. When joining Facebook as an engineer, you will still have many many choices of which team to join, and you'll make that decision after a few weeks of ""bootcamp"" which means you'll have an informed choice. It also means that the quality of engineers is high throughout the company because every person comes through the same interviewing process. One of my favorite aspects of Facebook culture is focusing on impact rather than hard work. Another is a recognition that you can advance your career without going into management, and that there are many different kinds of talent. There are several different ""archetypes"" of senior individual contributors that are recognized and encouraged to flourish.","Facebook has become more careful in certain core areas like Newsfeed, Timeline, Ads, and Platform. There are many stakeholders on these products and thus you've got to get a lot more things buttoned up before you can launch a product change in these core areas. We still do experiments but not quite as freely as before. Just understand that the more impact your product has, the tougher it will be to make changes, and place yourself in the company according to your preferences."
Do the best work of your life!,2018-09-05,"Anonymous Employee in Menlo Park, CA",5,,- Working with the smartest and best in my field which makes me better.  - We get to solve tough problems everyday - The open culture means tons of opportunities for everyone - Doing a ton of good in the world and taking action on what isn't working - Unbelievable support when you need it. I went through some personal challenges this year and Facebook was with me every step of the way. - We live our company values- they aren't just posters on the wall.,Achieving the Facebook mission demands a lot from all of us. It's important that you manage your work and life.
"So far, so good",2019-12-27,"Security Manager in Austin, TX",5,,Healthy work-life balance and boundaries; interesting work; no shortage of problems to solve and improvements to make.,"It can be a bit like drinking from a fire hose at first (and for a while), but that is just because there are just so many things going on, a wide range of interactions and interdependencies, and a ton of work to do. It can make things overwhelming, but just acknowledging it and doing what you can seems to be the right approach and management expectations are generally aligned with reality (so you're typically not expected to deliver on something beyond your abilities/influence)."

Working i,2020-03-12,"Software Engineer in New York, NY",5,,"The impact of what we do is great, the people I get to work with are amazing - very smart, collaborative, and nice. There's a great social vibe. Incredible benefits (what did I do to get all this?), and a strong sense of ownership and growth.","You will have to be proactive and deliberate about work-life balance. While you can have a great wlb, many prefer working harder to advance faster. Sometimes it's easy to forget that this is a choice. While within teams it really feels like a startup that moves really fast, sometimes there's some politics when interacting with different teams."
The toughest job you'll ever love.,2011-05-27,"in Palo Alto, CA",4,,"In general, there is a high level of autonomy given to employees. We're treated like adults and given lots of responsibility. The perks are unreal compared to other places I've worked. The atmosphere is fun yet serious. We're very lucky to work here overall.","A stretched thin workforce makes for lots of pressure and heavy workload; it's hard to get everything done. Sometimes it's difficult to strike a work/life balance. There's a clique-ish aspect to the place, where the ""cool kids"" get the recognition and more opportunity to move around and advance."
"Love the company and the mission, the day to day is tough",2013-09-11,"Analyst in New York, NY",5,,"Of course the perks are great, but the most important perk is working for a company I truly believe in. Mark is an incredible leader who wants to make the world a better place, and I love doing work for a mission I care about.","The employees are tough, and even harsh at times. There isn't a lot of hand holding or pats on the back, and being critical and outspoken is rewarded almost all the time. This can get exhausting."
Great place to work...very hard... but this teenager of a company is still trying to figure out its HR policies.,2014-06-08,"Anonymous Employee in Menlo Park, CA",3,,"The ""Move Fast"" reputation Facebook is known for is truly how it is inside the company. This makes getting the job done a much less painful experience. Truly an ""ask for forgiveness"" environment (no need to ask for permission). If there was no downside (which there is), I would give this company a rating of 5 stars hands down.","Facebook is still in its teenage years of development. While many HR processes & policies are mature (the hiring process is best I've seen), fraternization is overlooked (aka sex between coworkers, sometimes even in the office itself) and relationships within chain of command are accepted/overlooked - yet don't dare say ""pimp my ride"" in an open space as you will get your hands slapped."

Nice Benefits but Not True to Healthy Work/Life Balance They Promote,2016-10-18,"in Menlo Park, CA",3,,"The amenities are nice for full-time employees, but it feels like a smoke-screen almost.

Pretty fed up with research operations.,2020-03-01,"Research Program Manager in Menlo Park, CA",1,,* Working at Facebook looks good on your resume * I am never hungry * Pay is ok for what the work is,"God help anyone who joins this team. The managers cant lead their way out of paper bag. One manager especially is gross. She backstabs and manipulates everyone. When called out for any bias they ignore it. Also a few months ago they decided to give everyone the Research Program Manager title, regardless of level or experience so now junior recruiting coordinators share the same title as people with M.B.A.s.. There is no support for your impact and only the favorites get recognized. Pulse scores won’t change anything. I can’t wait to leave and let the next poor soul be miserable in my place. Facebook is not a bad company I really just cannot stand this team.   If anyone from HR is reading this, take a look at recent transitions/exits and notice the pattern for why people are leaving."

Fun work environment (free quality food, game rooms, frivolity encouraged, etc.).  High impact in terms of people using your code and recognition.  Good opportunities to try new ideas and move teams.","Brutally long hours for many, frequent pressure to delay or cancel vacation plans (even outside of release deadlines).  Harsh, unjust, and badly cross-team calibrated reviews coupled with frequent firings so that the stick is very close to the carrot.
