Best Company I've worked for thus far,2023-05-08,"Senior Data Analyst in Portland, OR",5,,"Good pay, clarity on pay structure, meaningful work","Extremely high expectations, hard to get promoted within a team"
I have died and gone to heaven,2023-03-22,"Program Manager in New York, NY",5,,"Compensation is nearly 2x my last role. Brilliant talent. Remote flexibility is amazing. Work/life balance is a real priority. Company values of belonging aren't just lip service, they actually carry over in all the little ways, which I've never seen before. Solving challenging and complex problems. I truly do like my job, and would like to stay here for a really really long time.","The vibe is a bit more serious than I expected - people have a really strong commitment to craft, and there's less joking around than I've experienced in past organizations. And (the flip side of the benefits of remote flexibility) it's a bit difficult to feel connected with coworkers given how little I see them IRL (I'm in NYC)"
Great job!,2023-05-06,"Superhost - Property Manager in Napa, CA",5,,I love being a superhost. Very rewarding.,Some months can be slow.

"Great company, strong DS team, interesting work. Not so great for DS Managers.",2023-03-23,"Data Science Manager in San Francisco, CA",5,,"It is a great company to work for, very interesting problems to work on, super smart people around.","Great place to be an IC, don't come here looking for a Manager role. Not great career prospects in the management space. The org has been flattened, with managers pushed to do IC work, unless they have at least 8 DS reports (which most rarely do). With hiring slowed down since 2020, managers can't find enough ICs to fill a team."
Fun company to work for,2023-04-25,"Data Scientist in San Francisco, CA",5,,"Great culture, cool problems. Marketplaces are great for data workers",The company is fairly large now
interesting characters,2023-04-01,"Host in San Diego, CA",4,,omg the best part is meeting new people who are on their life's journey and are friendly.,"the biggest challenge is avoiding people that are not good to have in your living space, and then dealing with the situations. I felt uncomfortable 10-15% of the time. some people have excellent success every time though. a lot of it has to do with pricing."

"Fulfilling, great leadership",2023-03-07,"Software Engineer in San Francisco, CA",5,,"The people are smart without the ego. The leadership is focused on the best customer experience as the number one priority. They adhere to the philosophy that profits will follow, not the other way around.","This is a place that's built by and for extroverts. That doesn't mean you can't fit in as an introvert, but you'll have to work a little harder."

Golden Handcuffs,2022-10-11,"Case Manager in Portland, OR",4,,Amazing benefits and really cool work environment. The office is gorgeous and they provide a variety of work spaces which makes it fun to work there! They even allow dogs! There are so many positive things about working in an Airbnb office that it made it really hard to leave.,"The job itself was miserable. I could never make everyone happy. I had to solve problems between the Hosts and the Guests. And often times both people felt like they were in the right. (someone is almost always wrong) I was constantly in the middle of two adults arguing. The phrase: ""The customer is always right"" doesn't really work when the Host and the Guest are both your customers. So often times solutions would leave one party unhappy which was very stressful for me. I didn't like feeling that way. Ultimately I left because I just wanted a Job that was less negative and stressful. But I do want to mention that this was just the nature of the job, it is not Airbnb's fault. Overall I feel very happy with the company and did not leave on bad terms. It just wasn't for me."

Airbnb needs to restructure HotelTonight ASAP,2022-04-07,"Customer Experience Agent in New York, NY",1,,Great benefits and lots of opportunity outside of your role to learn.,"HotelTonight CX team is managed by the same people for years and they seem to simply move teams around instead of breaking up the sorority that is our management team.  Airbnb has failed at fixing morale on this team and even worse seems to want us all to quit. This is a toxic environment that I had to leave for my sanity.  The D&B team is extremely discriminatory and only seems to believe in elevating black colleagues/LGBTQIA, meanwhile hispanics are struggling for an ounce of recognition and white co workers are demonized for their skin color even when allies."

The team I worked with had great teams and took their time to ensure I felt comfortable working there. The teams have people who have been with the company for several years and they have a great attitude about helping you grow.,The trainings aren't entirely covering every aspect you will need to know for your job. People don't really understand Airbnb's business model sometimes. You will get yelled at and told that the company isn't working how it should when they are supposed be educating themselves as a user when using the platform as well.
Good company,2022-01-12,"Host in Seven Heart Crossing, TX",4,,"They had a bit of a rocky start but the company has improved a lot. Much better at answering the phone!

"Great workplace, culture is declining",2022-03-04,"Operations Analyst in San Francisco, CA",4,,"Amazing perks, mission, values. Competitive salary.","I perceived the culture was declining, not because of remote. It felt like after IPO there were deliberate choices to be different from the previous Airbnb that affected all level of workplace."
Golden handcuffs,2022-02-23,"Safety Specialist in Portland, OR",3,,They have great benefits and a great community of people working there.,"It's very cult-like, or at least it was before the pandemic. Your pay depends on how involved you are with the ""community,"" and how much time you spend with coworkers. Also, it being a big company now, they value money over people 10 times out of 10. Would not recommend anyone to work there now."

Pretty cool place to work,2022-02-28,"Account Manager in Portland, OR",4,,The culture and energy of the company was wonderful.,Pay was low and minimal guidance
Look somewhere else,2021-06-01,"Trust and Safety Investigator in Portland, OR",1,,"Working with innovative, passionate people","Leadership, especially director and executive positions, do not listen to anyone regardless of their experience or talent. The company spends way more time on race and diversity training then the actual product, and customer service and the way deadly incidents are handled suffers greatly because of this. The ironic part is, that I have never worked with such a diverse group of people in my entire life. It was great! So why the company spends so much time trying to be a social justice warrior is way beyond anything someone would expect. The bottom line is this: the company does not care at all about safety. Many people who worked there had wonderful ideas that could have truly changed the dynamics there, but the executive levels did not care to hear about it at all, they only care if they make money - not if they make money the right way."

Also our internal experimentation platform. 4) I'm excited to work for a company that I think is genuinely making the world a better place by helping people connect and belong. I came to the US as a refugee, and Airbnb's stand for refugees made me proud to work here.  5) Internal mobility on the data science team is strongly encouraged and supported. Once you've been in your role for a year or two, you can start looking at other roles if you're interested. So there are always more problems to solve!","1) Airbnb moves really fast - roadmaps change frequently and it's sometimes hard to keep up. 2) While we're getting better at it, we still don't always think very long term."

"Crazy fast growth, awesome people and pay, often exhausting",2015-02-12,"Customer Experience Lead in Portland, OR",5,,"Airbnb is one of those rare employers that really cares about what you think. We hire only the best of the best, so opinions are welcome and heard from anywhere -- whether you've been here 6 months or 5 years. The perks are great: travel to SF at least once a year, the chance to visit other offices (including outsourcers), breakfast and lunch daily, dogs in the office, great pay, ""open concept"" office and work station options... it goes on and on. We also work effing hard and the work is fun and challenging. Managers trust you to make best judgement calls and empower you to do your best work. Even if you don't particularly get along with your direct lead, there are several others that are there to support you. There is a lot of opportunity to move up and around. We all trust each other with our lives.","Hyper growth has meant some things, like basic training, can be overlooked. If you aren't someone that can work without guidance this may not be the place for you. Initiatives often live for 2 weeks only to die and be brought up again months later. Change is constant. Communication is improving, but not perfect. Work life balance is incredibly hard to make work for a lot of people. There can be a atmosphere akin to ""drinking the koolaid."""

"For an engineer looking for product / technical learning and impact, Airbnb is an amazing fit",2014-11-03,"Software Engineer in San Francisco, CA",5,,"Airbnb has a strong positive culture - People are genuinely invested in the company / product and constantly talking about ways to make it better. It's intoxicating and makes it a lot more fun to go to work and think of your own ideas to improve Airbnb. For an engineer, a relatively small team (~140 engineers) working on a complex product makes for lots of opportunities for impact and ownership, even in the first couple months. The fast growth also adds to the ownership and career advancement opportunities, since a relatively short tenure at Airbnb can become seniority with all of the expansion and hiring. Additionally I feel like I've learned a ton both from other engineers and working collaboratively with designers, data scientists, and producers (product managers). Overall I don't think I would have shipped nearly the diverse and impactful set of projects at another company, nor feel the same sense of community among my team and coworkers. I interviewed at many companies before choosing Airbnb and I've never even been tempted to look back!","The product development process at Airbnb is chaotic. Features usually start as a brainstorm with input from designers, producers, engineers, etc. and coalesce into a (slightly) more concrete roadmap, with the producer taking the lead on shaping the plan. This roadmap can then shift as priorities or situations change, meaning you need to be able to roll with the punches and thrive on a little chaos. But it's not all a con, as having input into the product as an engineer is fun and the system gives engineers a lot of autonomy and discretion on their projects."
Incredible Place to Work,2015-02-12,"Customer Experience in Portland, OR",5,,"I work in the Portland office, so that's where my perspective is coming from. This is an incredibly unique place to work, and I'm delighted to be here. The office itself is awe-inspiring - Google it. The people I get to work with everyday are creative, hard working and easy to be with every day. The job itself, customer experience, is both challenging and rewarding. I've already learned a number of new skills in my 4 months here.","The way the leadership team is structured is confusing and, I think, convoluted. The team leads are hired externally, and thus don't have a clear understanding of the day-to-day work we have to do. When I have questions, I have to go to someone else off of my team, which puts me in a weird position when my manager is constantly asking what they can help me with. This is not my managers fault, it's just the way the structure is. I have been told that my manager's job is to help me develop my career goals, but since my manager is just as new as I am, they don't have the network connections or knowledge of the company to really help me develop where I want to go."

Eng support is more likely to go to passion projects instead of core product and the tools needed to maintain it. -Constant changes to the point where it becomes hard to do your job well. (This is well beyond the 'but we're a start-up, we gotta be scrappy, change is part of the ride, you have to roll with it' mentality) -People not being able to be honest with the cofounders about when they're off track. - Hiring an absurd amount of contractors and then continue to renew their contracts for 1+ years instead of hiring them full time."

Amazing company; amazing people; amazing opportunity for personal growth,2014-12-12,"IT Support Specialist in San Francisco, CA",5,,"There are tons of things I like about working here – the work environment is great, and really conducive to both individual work and collaboration; the culture is a perfect combination of all the things I think make people creative, productive, and happy; the people are both amazingly gifted and incredibly open and laid-back – however the best thing is that they're not afraid to dream big, and come across with goals some might consider ""lofty"". Our purpose is to ""create a sense of belonging"". I just find that really compelling. From lots of other companies that would seem kind of ""pie-in-the-sky""-like, but here, it feels incredibly genuine and gives meaning to all the smaller tasks that make up our work here.","Most of the ""pros"" could also be considered ""cons"" if you can't adapt properly. For example, the open, collaboration-inducing floor-plan could be distracting for some (I bought a good set of earphones and don't even think about it anymore). The fact that our company is young and growing quickly provides a huge opportunity for someone with initiative looking for personal growth – however there's not (yet) much in the way of organized career planning. (I just let my manager know this was something that was important to me, and I've found an amazing amount of support with things like training time, extra-curricular projects, and time to attend local events that pertain to what I want to grow into.)"

For an engineer, a relatively small team (~140 engineers) working on a complex product makes for lots of opportunities for impact and ownership, even in the first couple months. The fast growth also adds to the ownership and career advancement opportunities, since a relatively short tenure at Airbnb can become seniority with all of the expansion and hiring. Additionally I feel like I've learned a ton both from other engineers and working collaboratively with designers, data scientists, and producers (product managers). Overall I don't think I would have shipped nearly the diverse and impactful set of projects at another company, nor feel the same sense of community among my team and coworkers. I interviewed at many companies before choosing Airbnb and I've never even been tempted to look back!","The product development process at Airbnb is chaotic. Features usually start as a brainstorm with input from designers, producers, engineers, etc. and coalesce into a (slightly) more concrete roadmap, with the producer taking the lead on shaping the plan. This roadmap can then shift as priorities or situations change, meaning you need to be able to roll with the punches and thrive on a little chaos. But it's not all a con, as having input into the product as an engineer is fun and the system gives engineers a lot of autonomy and discretion on their projects."
Great business in spite of itself,2015-02-23,"Marketing in San Francisco, CA",2,,"Tons of energy, very smart and friendly people, incredible food program. The founders are good guys, well-meaning, even if their lack of experience comes through (which it does frequently). For a Silicon Valley company, Airbnb is about as diverse as you'll find, which is a huge plus. Very mission driven, but often in a naively optimistic way.","No understanding of work-life balance - just zilch. This causes burnout and selects for the young, energetic, and naive. The company really needs wisdom and experience in leadership, particularly right now during this period of fast growth, but it's currently loaded with yes-men that won't say no to the founders. In fact no one says no to the founders, even when their ideas are laughable. Employees are highly expendable - like family one minute, being shown the door the next."

The people I get to work with everyday are creative, hard working and easy to be with every day. The job itself, customer experience, is both challenging and rewarding. I've already learned a number of new skills in my 4 months here.","The way the leadership team is structured is confusing and, I think, convoluted. The team leads are hired externally, and thus don't have a clear understanding of the day-to-day work we have to do. When I have questions, I have to go to someone else off of my team, which puts me in a weird position when my manager is constantly asking what they can help me with. This is not my managers fault, it's just the way the structure is. I have been told that my manager's job is to help me develop my career goals, but since my manager is just as new as I am, they don't have the network connections or knowledge of the company to really help me develop where I want to go."

You have to advocate for yourself and develop a great relationship with your manager.  3. Liquidity: Airbnb isn't a public company so those looking to sell their stocks need to wait for a liquidity event or for the company to IPO. As much as stocks are great, they can't pay the bills so giving employees more opportunity to cash out is important for those of us who aren't billionaires.

That is because you are being taken for granted.  Drama. Obvious favoritism as people are promoted or passed over with more regard for their social status than their competencies.

It's a really special place and helluva lot of fun.","Airbnb is still a startup in many ways. While in my eyes it's pretty awesome to be a part of a company that's young, dynamic and rapidly growing, some may find it a bit too crazy. We're still figuring out things as we go, and it's not always clear what the process is and who owns what. It gives those that are proactive and interested in having an impact on how Airbnb does things, a lot of opportunity, but it's admittedly not for everyone. Some may find it a bit chaotic. And yes, a lot of folks work very hard here and work/life balance is a bit low. For me, I love what I do and I don't mind a few late nights."
"People are nice, sometimes overly nice, almost hypocritical",2017-04-27,"Software Engineer in San Francisco, CA",3,,"People are nice to each other. Lots of positive thinking; lots of cheerleading. My team is hosting birthdays, anniversaries for every member.  Definitely politically correct, sometimes feel like overly correct.","Cannot speak for other teams, but in my team, performance is purely based upon results. And not on any good results, but certain results desired by the management. You could easily find your contribution ""annulled"" because those results aren't what are cared about by managers.   People tend to avoid direct confrontation and being nice in the first place, then you might find yourself backstabbed. Are there lots of politics? I've seen worse in other places. Lots of people pretend to be caring about core values, cultures, goodness but actually what they care might just be stock units and compensation. This is frustrating to me as I sincerely joined because of some idealistic belief. Now I'm just loathing myself for being naive and stupid.  Well, guess I'll just have to eat the xx up and carry on...."
Run away while you still can!,2017-08-25,"Account Manager in San Francisco, CA",2,,"- Great food (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and amazing snacks) -A plethora of opportunities to travel the world - Impressive name on your resume","Promises are made again and again and there is no follow-up. You can't trust your manager, and to make it worse, you have an abundance of inexperienced managers that unfortunately are not given the tools they need to succeed.  Airbnb is bleeding money and talent, and it doesn't know how to fix it. The level of bureaucracy is unacceptable for a company its age and size. It behaves like a company of 100,000 employees, when it only has 3,000. The growing pains are being felt all over the company, and people are discouraged.   I wish I had a real perspective of what was happening on the inside before accepting my offer. The culture is (or was) amazing, but it won't be enough to make you happy amidst this mess."
High Energy and High Impact Opportunity,2014-11-04,"Anonymous Employee in San Francisco, CA",5,,Amazing energy and motivation across the Company. Clear focus on making a positive impact and doing things differently. Co-workers are very intelligent and dedicated to doing the best work possible. Airbnb takes great care of its employees - more so than any company I've seen to date including Google. The perks and work environment are carefully thought out for what people really want instead of creating a laundry list of things to try to impress people.,"Work-life balance is challenging and there are definite growing pains. Many early employees are learning to adjust to the change of being a growing, now mid-size company - some are doing better than others unfortunately. This causes some politics from time to time and leads to some employee turn-over. The average age of employees is in the mid-20s and the social activities definitely cater to younger people. Employees with families and other responsibilities definitely get left out from time to time."

Engineering isn't a core part of the culture, and it shows in the quality and visibility of the team's work. - Systems receive low traffic levels (compared to those in search, ads, social networking, etc.), so little need to improve efficiency or innovate in the backend space - Weak engineering leadership that won't make hard technical decisions, push through cross-team initiatives like SOA - Senior IC promotions and external hires based more on visibility than technical skill and impact - Steady stream of departures by strong engineers and managers - Culture of niceness and praise to the extreme. Hard to provide constructive feedback, push back against bad projects. - Cramped, noisy desk areas with low-quality monitors and office furniture - Below average meals and snacks"

Generally good but lack of accountability in work can be maddening.,2014-07-13,"Customer Experience Lead in San Francisco, CA",3,,"I've met some of the most interesting and unique people from all backgrounds here; I can say that for most of my working time here I have genuinely loved my team and my colleagues. I've also had a lot of freedom to act and take decisions without tons of oversight, and I felt very empowered and happy about this. The compensation and benefits are good.","The freedom I mentioned above has started to go away; as they attempt to run themselves like a real company and not a start-up, there is a sensation of an iron fist clamping down on us. Trying to become a real company (with accountability, transparency, and future profitability) without becoming corporate is hard. Right now I don't feel that Airbnb is doing very well with that."
Airbnb is a Great Place to Work,2017-06-14,"Director in San Francisco, CA",5,,"Mission driven leaders and people. Hosting permeates the buildings. Core values are strong and real. Learning opportunities are endless if you think about it as growth in experience, not just career progression. Good balance of creative and business savvy at the Leadership levels. Citizenship work / help with refugees in inspiring.","Leadership working on scaling / process to scale. It's struggling with startup culture and grown up company. But it's finding it's way. Pace of work can be exhilarating, but if you aren't resilient and clear about your boundaries, it can be hard on your work/life balance. But work/life balance is possible."
Pretty darn awesome!,2015-02-26,"Customer Experience Specialist in Portland, OR",4,,"Fantastic benefits including food, travel coupons, schedule flexibility. My direct lead is fantastic and I feel as though this company has built a family of close friends. Airbnb prides itself on making sure we feel part of a bigger community as well as maintaining a unique (and fun!) work culture. The workspaces provide a great environment you can feel comfortable doing your job in. Lots and lots of social opportunities happening, so there is always something to do with your coworkers after you clock out, if that's your thing. Also free booze!","Compensation is competitive, however climbing the ladder to the next level can prove difficult. This company is trying to figure out how to promote and retain employees, but in the meantime you have to find your own place in the company by making the right connections (that political b.s.). Upper management seems aloof of the day-to-day workflows and job requirements. They arbitrarily make unreasonable goals without ever asking for employee feedback and/or understanding the nature of the work we do."
Analyst,2016-04-03,"Analyst in San Francisco, CA",5,,"Amazing people, great culture, lots of opportunities to learn and be exposed to different aspects of the company. Brian, Joe and Nate (co-founders) make themselves super accessible given their workload and I've learned so much from the regular (bi-weekly) talks they do. I remember reading a glassdoor post before I took the job, which described working at Airbnb as ""life changing, in a good way."" I couldn't agree more!","No 401k matching and almost no financial assistance for education. :(  Of course, it always comes down to your boss and team. I have a 5-star amazing one, but I have a few friends in the company who haven't been so lucky in terms of their managers. Most managers are strong, but because the company's grown so fast I think there are a few people in management positions that aren't right for them or that they don't have experience with. Again though, this has impacted a small number of the many people I know at the company."
Style over substance,2018-03-18,"Anonymous Employee in San Francisco, CA",2,,"- More diverse workforce than other tech companies I've been at, which is heartening","- Work/Life balance is non-existent. Good luck trying to have a personal life after you start working here. - The pay is pretty paltry, no bonus structure, equity package is nothing to write home about. - Decisions are frequently based on ""feelings"" rather than data, which can be infuriating. Data-driven decision making and overall rigor is not something that's naturally part of the culture. It varies team to team based on whether someone came from a company that was better at utilizing data in everyday work. - Airbnb likes to do everything their own way even if there are existing solutions in the market. Not very smart if they think reinventing the wheel is always the right decision. - The caliber of employees at Airbnb is not nearly as good as ones I've worked with at ""Big 4"" tech companies, but they sure think they are hot shots. A lot of arrogance fuels the company at every level. There's a lot of style over substance here. - The SF office looks great out in the atrium, but the desk areas tend to be dark, cramped and loud. Not the best environment for concentrating and getting things done. - Employees get their personal items stolen off their desks on a regular basis with little assistance from Security team. - This is very much a hospitality company first and foremost, and a tech company second. Quite a culture shock if you're coming from a die hard tech company (consumer/enterprise software, AR, VR, robotics, gaming, etc). I've experienced this numerous times: mentioning something marginally technical and being faced with blank stares. - The company is a hot mess internally. No standardization in software, minimal cross-team collaboration, no version history in the codebase (well there might be some but not for everything that gets committed), lots of politics and jockeying for position/visibility, teams are very protective rather than collaborative seemingly forgetting we all work at the same place for the same goals."
It Is Not What It Appears From The Outside,2017-05-07,"Data Engineer in San Francisco, CA",1,,"Airbnb is no doubt a rocket ship. The culture is great, breeds friendliness. Some of the smartest people around in Silicon Valley.","- Data Engineers Are Treated As Second Class Citizens.  - Blogs might give you the impression that there is fancy engineering or data science going on at Airbnb, but that is not true, with the exception of a few open source projects. We have a hard time attracting top data science talent relative to our peers.  - Many managers are not technical enough to understand what we are doing, leads to a bungled performance review process.  - Arrogant attitude that this is the best place to work and why would you want to work anywhere else. Not sure where we lost our humility along the journey... - Lots of red-tape, the speed and innovation at which things happen extremely slow. Generally people are risk averse"
Fun company full of wonderful caring people,2015-01-19,"Software Engineer in San Francisco, CA",5,,"The people are amazing - passionate, competent, quirky and interesting. The perks are fantastic. The rapid growth makes it a great place to learn, since you're constantly solving new technical and social problems. You really can own your own impact and find the best projects for yourself; this requires being able to argue for your point of view, but learning how to do that is a great opportunity in itself. The company really does care about the users, and has a fundamentally positive impact on the world.","The office is crazy crowded, which can make it hard to focus. Hiring lots of new grads means a lot of time is spent answering questions and trying to train the recruits. Also, the interview load is pretty heavy.

The stuff you have to drink to succeed here, yeesh. Half of the things people say make you wonder if some giant, anthropomorphic glass pitcher is going to bust through the wall at any moment, bellowing ""OH YEAHHHH."" I mean, it's totally normal to do your job well AND maintain a sense of personal identity and independence at the same time. I wish that concept was celebrated more often and people weren't hamstrung by an unwillingness to buy into the cult and saturate themselves with Airbnb Kool-Aid.   + Leadership. There is no transparency of what leadership actually does. Many people openly do nothing and micro-manage the joy out of the company while everybody below them (people who are no less intelligent and motivated) do all the work."

If you completely buy into the culture in all aspects, this will be the best job you ever have.","There is not a lot of room for dissent, and the organization is aggressively political in nature. There is a heavy emphasis on fitting in and being the part of the ""Airbnb culture"", and those who don't fit in usually won't last very long. They emphasized diversity in all aspects of the company but thought."
Such an Amazing Loving Culture,2017-12-06,"Cloud Engineer in San Francisco, CA",5,,"Love love love. There is so much love amongst people here. Culture fit interviews to weed about people who can't get along with others and does not have team belongingness. Food is not great but good, love micro kitchens. Good work life balance. People are very understanding. Say if you need to work from home for month or few because of some family emergency. Holiday shutdown. Everyone gets off from Dec 20th till Jan 1st. That's amazing. Very competitive pay. Similar to Google, Fb, Uber, Lyft, Stripe etc. Business outlook is very strong. Where other tech unicorns like uber are burning cash, we are profitable and increasing that yoy.

"A Magical, Challenging, Ongoing Party with Some of the Best People in the World",2015-02-12,"Business Analyst in San Francisco, CA",5,,"My favorite part about working at Airbnb is the dedication of the founders. They are often here before me or working later than anyone in the office. Coming from another start up where the founders were constantly traveling or just MIA, this dedication speaks volumes about the overall energy in Airbnb. The founders show a genuine wonder at the company they've built, and that humble attitude translates into an incredible work environment. The culture and core values are actively embraced by everyone. I would look forward to grabbing lunch or happy hour with any single coworker. As a rapid growth company, the work is challenging but rewarding. You will impact the company with the work that you do.","This is not a company that hands out gold stars. Everyone works hard, and they expect and trust others to work hard. You are not micromanaged, which is a Pro in my book. If you're someone that needs your responsibilities and goals spelled out, this is not the environment for you."
Not the company I used to love,2017-03-31,"Anonymous Employee in San Francisco, CA",3,,The founders and their passion for the Airbnb's mission. The workspaces are beautiful and perks are great as well.,"The environment has gotten quite political in the last couple of years. Because of the flat structure across the eng org, it is hard to move up and getting a title change - ex: they don't have a Senior Manager or Senior Director title. The performance review process has gotten more subjective rather than based on quantifiable numbers over the past year as well. Also, while the company and teams don't hesitate to throw money at extravagant offsites and parties, managers have to fight to ensure their employees are getting the pay raise they deserve."
Amazing group of people aligned on a great mission,2015-10-14,"CX Manager in San Francisco, CA",5,,"-Genuinely collaborative and supportive culture. I've experienced this working with people across all departments. -Caliber of hiring for unique combination of functional expertise + cultural fit. The result is a cool blend of great people from the early days, as well as experts from their respective areas, all working together well. -More data-driven decisions than some aesthetic-driven decision from early days. I've met some of the smartest and friendliest data-scientists here, all who have surfaced interesting insights from our data. -Accessibility and transparency of senior leadership. I'm amazed that, even at our company's size, there are still at least weekly company-wide meetings where we can hear about various topics from Brian and other senior leaders.","-Operations and internal processes are generally quite inefficient, but things are getting better. Its a downside of the rapid growth, but sometimes its difficult figuring out who decides on what and how those things should be coordinated through the org. -IT infrastructure still somewhat start-up grade, but improving quickly. Wifi seems to go down regularly (and sometimes power does too)."
Looks Are Deceiving,2015-08-16,"Customer Experience in Portland, OR",3,,"One of the best jobs I've ever had Free meals, benefits, and happy hours Decent flexibility Not always stuck doing the same thing","Does not cater to the non-20s, introverted, person who is both family and career driven. Basically, you need to pick one, your family or your career. Example, more career opportunities to those who are available to always work overtime. Young leadership who expect growth despite their lack of ability to coach effectively or measure productivity. There is no communication or cohesion amongst junior managers, while senior managers are unable to properly communicate the vision and expectations with those below them. Many are unwilling to change. Example. different managers expect different things, even from the same individual. People with disabilities are often seen as more trouble instead of proper coaching. Example, if you suffer from mental disability you are often seen as a weak link. Competition creating nightmares for many employees. Example, everyone applying for the same job with generally the same experience because they want to get away from where they already are. Coverups by senior leaders so their junior leaders aren't looking as bad as they are. Example, leaders not knowing boundaries when it comes to hooking up with coworkers or borderline alcoholism. Lack of accountability for all the above.  To sum it all up, if you want feel like you're in high school, it's a good place to work."
"High expectations, low impact",2016-11-07,"Software Engineer in San Francisco, CA",3,,Good benefits and pay. Definitely a cool company to work for resume-wise. A good IPO will be a big pay day to employees but if you don't care much about money maybe other companies can be more challenging and better for your career.,"Engineering management is really bad. Managers do not pay attention to career growth given that career ladder is taboo inside the company, nobody talks or knows their position is, so don't expect your manager to advice you much about how to go from level a to level b, c ... etc.   When people get bored at their current position they either switch teams or branch out to management (lateral moves) which feeds back into the problem where management focuses on reporting green numbers to upper management."

Projects get scraped if it's not sexy enough. My department was prideful about working in the realms of ambiguity. I personally think this is an unhealthy habit to work under.  There is movement, but you have to be smart and act on it. However, even if you move into a new role, it's not always guaranteed secure or of any value towards your career development.

Pay is out of this world. Office is located in the city so no hopping on a bus to South Bay.","Leadership is still figuring things out. Half of the staff is contractors. They claim to never have headcount to hire anyone new, but the company hires 50+ people a week.

Exec level needs to make this a top priority, as it will end up sapping the energy and production levels of the corporate team. Recently when employees were hounded (with top brass approval) outside the office and in the lobby to vote for a particular candidate in the city elections, many associates were offended at this crossing over the line into personal life and personal political choice."

I felt like I'd been looking for a job like this all my life, and I could finally settle in to my work family environment. It's been a year now, and I don't feel like I belong anymore.  Reasons for this: - Yes, you can bring your dog to work, but your name won't exist anymore. Your name will now be your ""dog's name + mom/dad"" - If you don't like going out all the time, and prefer to do your work and come home, not a good place for you. I'm an introvert at heart, and this is an extrovert workplace. It's expected that you go to happy hours, events, etc. - Your life outside of work is important, until metrics take over. When I first started, I was told my schedule could flex for my commitments outside of work. Now I have to leave early because they are strict with the 1 weekend day schedule. - If you need quiet to get work done, this is not the place for you.

It Is Not What It Appears From The Outside,2017-05-07,"Data Engineer in San Francisco, CA",1,,"Airbnb is no doubt a rocket ship. The culture is great, breeds friendliness. Some of the smartest people around in Silicon Valley.","- Data Engineers Are Treated As Second Class Citizens.  - Blogs might give you the impression that there is fancy engineering or data science going on at Airbnb, but that is not true, with the exception of a few open source projects. We have a hard time attracting top data science talent relative to our peers.  - Many managers are not technical enough to understand what we are doing, leads to a bungled performance review process.  - Arrogant attitude that this is the best place to work and why would you want to work anywhere else.

"Airbnb has been the most socially, technically, and financially rewarding company I have ever worked for.",2014-12-10,"Software Engineer in San Francisco, CA",5,,"The people are without question the best reason to work at Airbnb. It is an incredibly welcoming culture that values learning and passionate endeavors of all sorts.

Outside of the people: there are deep technical challenges to solve, there is a supportive environment for learning and personal development, there is freedom and incentive to travel, and the pace of growth means there's always new challenges.","The rate of growth means that sometimes things are a bit chaotic.

"Amazing place to work, better than Facebook",2015-02-13,"Software Engineer in San Francisco, CA",5,,"I'm a software engineer that previously worked at Facebook. I can definitely say that the work here is more exciting than my previous company. Airbnb is a much smaller company and each engineer plays a large role in the impact of the company. I enjoy the company culture and you'll feel a ton of energy in the office. We move fast and are always making big changes to our product. As a engineer here, you get a lot of say over how the product is designed and control on what projects you want to work on.","The benefits are great but the perks can not match Facebook.

A Business with a LOT of heart and soul,2015-07-13,"Recruiting Coordinator in San Francisco, CA",5,,"1. You can bring your whole self to work 2. Everyone is extremely respectful, I have never seen so many people hold the door for each other. 3. Gaining work/life balance is encouraged (part of my personal OKRs set by my manager)  4. Culture is at the forefront of everyone in senior management's mind. Making this a place that is not only profitable but they want you to be able to grow as a person and in your career. 5. No matter how crazy my day is, there is an INCREDIBLE support system in my coworkers to help me through the day. There isn't a feeling of competition between peers the way that it can be at other companies",1. Feedback can be hard for people to give. It's important to establish you can handle constructive feedback in the beginning.
A great place for data scientists,2018-08-18,"Data Scientist in San Francisco, CA",5,,"- Lots of great people (smart, skilled, empathetic & kind) both on the DS team and across the company. - Tons of opportunities to learn and grows as a DS through great lunch & learns (with great external speakers as well), internal workshops and mini-conference like data days. Amazing for data nerds. Lots of opportunities for DS mentorship from experienced folks if you seek it out. $1000 Education stipend. - Competitive compensation for DS and other positions. Company is profitable and usually generous to its employees. - All the usual great perks of a Sillicon Valley company like food, great snacks, flexible working hours, lots of benefits etc + $2000 in Airbnb credits/year - Great tooling and always improving on this (Knowledge Repo, data portal, R, Python servers, modeling platform etc) - Decent company growth and diversification - Not everything is perfect, but DS leadership listens, is open to feedback and acts on the feedback - Great company and DS brand - Strong data culture: data has a strong voice and DS are respected. People are eager to learn more about data through Data U. Focus on data self sufficiency etc. - Absolutely stunning office. Visitors are always amazed. - Inclusive, diverse and welcoming culture","- Waiting for IPO. Company took action to increase cash comp in the meantime (which was highly appreciated!), but still would be great to IPO soon - Still lots of improvement for data tooling (Superset, pipelining etc) and data quality - Often stretched thin, which can be stressful. Need to hire more DS faster - Food is sometimes great, sometimes just ok - Wish the office was closer to public transportation. Lyft credits mostly solve this, though. - Sometimes I feel like there can be too much of a SJW vibe, but I suppose this is a byproduct of having lots of highly empathetic and kind people."
Great place to work!,2015-02-12,"Project Manager in San Francisco, CA",5,,"Really friendly people - it's sometimes surprising how genuinely enthusiastic people are about getting to know each other. The perks - 3 healthy/delicious meals a day (I save so much $$ on groceries!), travel coupon ($500 credit every quarter = $2000/year in Airbnb credits), full medical/dental/vision(!) The mission - I feel proud to work at a company that has a social element to its mission, it's not only empowering people economically while taking advantage of under-utilized space, but it's also making the world a smaller, more connected place by fostering intimate cross-cultural experiences.",It's growing so quickly that it can be difficult to keep track of who's in charge of what. The company's priorities around marketing and design can sometimes seem strange given the threats to its business model from a regulatory standpoint. It'd be great if there was more transparency with employees (and users) around these issues.
Should Have Been My Dream Job...,2020-02-15,"Sales and Marketing Coordinator in Portland, OR",3,,"Incredible office spaces, pride in working for a really cool company, Mission and Value-driven Executive Leadership, Very good technology infrastructure and employee technical support infra, work from home flexibility, Ambitious and motivated co-workers","As I said, this should have been my Dream Job... unfortunately, middle management on my team was so destructive that I had no choice but to move on. Hyper growth on the Vacation Rentals/Hotels team led to people being advanced into People Management who were not only unqualified but actively DISLIKED managing people. How this manifested: - Toxic work environment, including managers and directs openly bashing other employees, clients and partner businesses.  - Creating environments of exclusion based on popularity and who knows who outside of work.  - Gatekeeping of critical information from the top down, disrupting and discouraging career development and the free-flow of creativity and innovation. - Lack of career development or sales training - Dishonesty from upper management and middle management about the organizational changes coming up, causing employees to waste time not looking into their other career options.  Regarding compensation - there are dozens of employees responsible for bringing on new accounts and growing existing accounts, however there is no pay structure that rewards employees for doing such. It's all base pay and no bonus and no incentive to be successful financially.   Although leaving Airbnb was a difficult decision, I am confident it was the best for now given the severely negative updates I receive from my former colleagues. Hopefully someday the upper and middle management of the VR/Hotel organization will work through these issues and find a more functional and productive work environment for people to thrive in."
The ride of a lifetime; not for the motion-sick,2016-03-20,"Customer Experience Manager in Portland, OR",5,,I've worked in many customer service and management positions and this is far and away the best. You will get back what you put in. The jobs are challenging and things change all the time. If this is your jam and you want to create something and bust your bum to do it this is the place for you. Be ready to get on board for anything and figure it out on the way.,"If you aren't comfortable with ambiguity and daily change, I'd suggest passing on this one."
A frat house with a lot of macs,2012-12-12,"Current Member of Remote Team in Atlanta, GA",2,,"-fabulous product - the ability to help everyday people expand their income and make friends around the world; it's really a wonderful thing that is changing the world one reservation at the time -The ability to work from home from your first day of employment (if you're in a remote position, but even the SF-based employees can work from home one day a week). -depending on your job, a new Airbook laptop for your use -quarterly travel credit (although they put a bunch of restrictions on the use of it, which sort of makes it feel like a rebate) -the actual Airbnb hosts out in the world, for the most part, are really interesting and remarkable people -The Customer Support team is full of genuine, friendly, smart, and reliable people.","Many employees do not receive health insurance or other standard full-time benefits until 6 to 12 months after they begin work with the company, so do not be fooled by the shiny promises on the jobs page. I have had 4 different managers in 1 year and none of them had/have the experience or skills to effectively lead a team. (Leadership is not having a big ego or ordering people around.) No one's word means anything at Airbnb. People say one thing one day and then the next day they do a different thing. This is not me being resistant to innovation or change. I'm talking about basics like meetings you've set up, human resources issues, or even just responding to emails. You really can't rely on anyone to do what they promised. People don't communicate well and there are few people who take responsibility for their actions. People with no experience or expertise make decisions that make absolutely no sense to the people putting those policies into effect. Management rarely communicates to the employees who have to execute these changes nor the community of users who rely on the site what they are planning to change. Airbnb is losing the group of hosts who first joined them before it was a cause celebre, the ones who helped them get where they are today, and it's a shame. It's also losing smart, devoted employees who are tired of being subject to the whims, empty promises, and poor management skills of their supervisors. If you are a smart, mature person with integrity you will have a hard time here because most of the employees are not grown up and do not value or possess critical thinking skills. There's so much more I could say, but these are all the things I wish I had known before I accepted a job there. Working at Airbnb has been a real disappointment."
"Great people and office, growing pains galore.",2016-03-16,"Customer Experience Specialist in Portland, OR",3,,"The office is amazing, incredibly designed by employees, and is a neat environment to work in. The perks are superb such as on-site chefs to cook you breakfast and lunch, premium free health insurance, monthly commute reimbursement, company parties, dogs in the office, and lots of swag.","As an employee who joined near the end of the hiring cycle in Portland, a lot of us were lost in the masses. The company started out being tight nitched, and it was easy to feel unwelcome as a new employee. Other workers had a sense of annoyance by the presence of new employees, not really welcoming.   Leadership is sometimes based on tenure and not on whether or not they are the best fit. If you're not doing well, is easy to get reprimanded for it without much consideration for what support you need from leadership.   The schedule was once consistent, and now it's all over the place. We were told we weren't have to work weekends, but that quickly changed. Now employees will only get one day off between five day stretches, which is really exhausting with all the energy this job takes.   There's a lot of emphasis put onto the social aspect of the job. If you're an introvert, it's easy to get worn out on all the social events and need to be social in order to advance in the company.   Career opportunities are few and far between. Although you can adavance every six months within your role, getting out of that role seems impossible.   Burnout and bitterness can be seen in the workers who have been here for awhile. Some employees have gotten bonuses in the office, while other people who have achieved great things and global recognition in the company have received nothing. The ones who have benefitted from these perks make it loudly known to other people in the office, disrupting other people's work and morale. There's an emphasis on office culture, and this has just killed it for a lot of employees."
Amazing work place with amazing people,2016-08-02,"Data Scientist in San Francisco, CA",5,,"- Culture is amazing. Picture colleagues setting up a fake coffee shop every week to make free coffee, ice cream given out randomly, people sing happy birthday every week. - People are smart. Like super smart. It's humbling to work with them. - Challenging and meaningful problems to solve. - Empowers everyone to develop their individuality. - Lots of emphasis on movement between teams as good thing. - French toast Fridays are insane.","- Scrappy work environment, lots of things to do that competes for attention. - Constant changes, can feel unorganized from time to time. - Hard to remember who's the right point of contact. - Lots of tribal knowledge that took a long time to learn."
"Great Mission, Positive Impacts, Lacking in Implementation",2014-11-03,"Anonymous Employee in San Francisco, CA",4,,"Everyone - from the founders to execs to the most junior employees - works there because they believe in the positive impacts of the business. That mission drives all decisions to an extent I've never seen at any other company. Truly inspiring.  Airbnb hires collaborative, driven, smart people. There are few internal politics and lots of team work. You feel the positive and energetic atmosphere when you walk in the door.","The company claims to care about fair and competitive employee compensation, but has repeatedly botched efforts to ""level"" and ""adjust"". It's clear they count on employees to stay because of the mission rather than the compensation.  The company has grown really fast and hierarchy and process have been slow to follow. It's still a bit of a mess when it comes to decision-making and execution. This comes straight from the top - the founders and execs are the worst offenders.  Work-life-balance is still a big work-in-progress."
Love working here!,2018-06-20,"Recruiter in San Francisco, CA",5,,"I absolutely love working here. The culture is amazing, the pay is great, and I couldn't ask for a better team. As a recruiter I get treated as a partner rather than a subordinate, which is empowering and helps me to get things done.","Things change quickly, and leadership isn't always transparent. That could be frustrating for some who want to be in the know and crave a steady work environment, but the company is still small and growing quickly so this certainly meets my own expectations."
Work hard - Play Hard,2015-10-16,"Trust &Amp; Safety Investigator in Portland, OR",5,,I could not imagine life anywhere else.  This company offers great benefits and truly cares about their employees well-being.  There is lots of room to grow either within your position or a different department if you work hard towards your goal.  There are two many pro's to name but a few of them definitely are:  -Great intelligent employees  -Family environment -Great culture  -No micro management -Lots of room to grow  etc.,Things change a little fast sometimes with Airbnb still being a start-up company. It can get a little stressful and overwhelming.  It also seems like there may be a little favoritism within the teams sometimes which causes the wrong people to get promoted faster than others.  Another thing that bothers me is the lack of family friendliness - although there has been recent positive change.
Innovative company and exciting place to work,2017-02-21,"Anonymous Employee in San Francisco, CA",5,,"- Overall, Airbnb is a great place to work. People are smart, enthusiastic, and passionate about the company. I look forward to going to the office.  - Can feel good about the product.

Management stated that the average promotion would take 3-5 years for the team. Tends to not promote from within and hire outside for the same skillset. Tons of talent have been lost because of this.

"Good People, Empty Promises",2016-05-14,"Anonymous Employee in Portland, OR",3,,"Incredible work atmosphere Wonderful colleagues Strong company direction and buy-in Perks (free meals, happy hours, travel credits, etc.)","Professed emphasis on career growth - that seems to be a lot of smoke and mirrors. Likely due to such a strong increased candidate pool that internal hiring is no longer based on potential.

Disappointing Experience But Looks Great on Paper.,2014-01-20,"Anonymous Employee in San Francisco, CA",2,,"Very smart, forward thinking people.

Strong focus on mission and culture,2015-01-04,"Software Engineer in San Francisco, CA",5,,"I would not like to reiterate all the pros and cons other people have mentioned. To me, the most defining difference of Airbnb from other companies I have seen is the company's mission and positive, well-cultivated work culture.   Although Airbnb is a for-profit corporation, we put a lot of stress on in our mission - ""belong anywhere"". Before I traveled on Airbnb after becoming an employee, I had different kinds of traveling experiences and have started to think traditional quick and hurried ways of travel is not right and even possibly wrong. Although Airbnb makes money from guests and hosts, we also try hard to communicate the reason why you should start traveling with locals on Airbnb, instead of using hotels. Travel experiences on Airbnb are very different from person to person and can be transformative. I feel I work for a company that can change the way people think about traveling.  Airbnb has a distinctive culture. People are smart and at the same time have interesting stories to share, and everyone values learning from others. During my cultural fit interview (Airbnb is the only company for which I have ever done a culture fit interview for an engineering position), one of my interviewers asked me “what can you teach me right now?"" That was one of the most difficult interview questionsI have ever had. After a bit of hesitation, I taught my interviewer how to practice standing meditation, which I learned just a week before the interview at an Insight Meditation session. We ask this question to many candidates. We encourage people to share a ""fun fact"" when you are first introducing yourself or when you are presenting at team meetings. I have learned people at Airbnb have so many interesting experiences to share and feel humbled to work with them everyday. We have a ""Hands on Nerds"" session organized by one of our engineers where we teach ""skills"" to each other - these can be technical or be non-technical like how to do screen printing or how to dance Bhangra, an indian traditional dance. This culture also applies to day-to-day work. After an incident caused by human errors is resolved, engineers write a postmortem and share it with all product team members to teach and share, not to blame and ask for an apology. Senior engineers are willing to spend time discussing your mistakes to help you become a better engineer. Every weekly engineering meeting starts with appreciation time when people thank others who helped them or had done great work in that week.  For a general perspective about working at Airbnb, read other people's reviews. Factors like compensation, hours, and perk matter to me and what is being said by others is largely true. But for me, the mission and the culture are more important reasons that makes me feel excited to go to work everyday.","I cannot think of major cons except for things might happen at any other hyper-growth company.

I look forward to each day at Airbnb,2014-11-19,"Data Engineer in San Francisco, CA",5,,"Compensation/Benefits: Industry competitive compensation (including equity program), 100% coverage for health, dental, and vision insurance. This year (2014), we'll be shutting down the office for the last two weeks in December (in addition to my 2 weeks of vacation + 5 Holidays).   Day-to-Day: Working in data at Airbnb is an exciting place to be. We're currently a small team (but scaling upward), which allows for a lot of creative input into the future direction of the company's data culture. In my 6 months at Airbnb, I've gained ample exposure to trending Bay Area data technologies (Hadoop/Hive/Presto), and work with a highly capable team of tremendously smart individuals.   Food Program: All meals are provided (free of charge) by our world class culinary team. This includes breakfast, lunch, dinner, and various snacks throughout the day. We also have an excellent coffee/tea program (Da La Paz coffee/Four Barrel Espresso/). If it's your thing, you can also make your own espresso drinks on an industrial La Marzocco machine (after going through a training session).  Office Space: The Airbnb office space is incredible. Ours is an open workspace with tons of natural lighting (skylights and large windows). The workspace has become a bit crowded/noisy in recent months, but things should improve when the 3rd floor renovation is complete. This will increase our available floorspace and meeting room capacity by 150%. We're also planning to move to 100% self-actuating sit/stand desks in the future.   Culture: The working culture at Airbnb is very relaxed, allowing you to show who you really are. People are very accepting and genuine, so there's no need to put on your corporate work facade each day. The company also works hard to keep a good social element. Weekly Friday happy hours (rotating between creative on-site events, and bartabs at local establishments) are always a good place to start your weekend, and meet folks in other teams. We also have seasonal parties (Thanksgiving, Winter Holiday Party, Summer Celebration, One Airbnb ), which are highlights on the social calendar. For Summer Celebration this year, we bussed the entire company to Russian River for a full day on the river.   Travel Culture: Being a travel/hospitality company, we're highly encouraged to use our product. We're given a $2000 travel stipend on Airbnb ($500 quarterly). Long multi-week vacations are encouraged.","No 401k Match available  Airbnb is a relatively young company, where there still figuring things out. Things are moving fast, which can be frustrating for some people. Yesterday's strategy may differ entirely from todays, which may require more adaptability than is typical for most jobs. Prior to joining Airbnb, I worked for large companies with more traditional data cultures. Best practices were better established, and the tools were more stable. At Airbnb, things are quite the opposite, which has often led to frustration. But, overall, I think the challenge is worthwhile."
"great company to work. lively and fun culture, lots of people to learn from",2014-12-29,"Software Engineer in San Francisco, CA",5,,"I've been working at airbnb for a year as a software engineer. Top two things I like is how helpful people are. Instead of wasting 2 hours trying to figure it out on my own, if I get stuck, I ask for help, and people spend the time to both answer the question, and explain a bit more so I actually understand what's going on. Within my first few weeks, I was amazed at how much I learned, and now a year into the job, I feel very knowledgeable in my area, and pass on the favor by helping new hires. The second favorite thing about Airbnb is the people. I'm a new grad, and I really like the fun culture, a mix of people who are chill, but also those who like to go out and party a bit more. Nothing that crazy, probably doesnt compare to facebook's epic parties, but I'm more than happy. And it's a great crowd. Also, our office is amazing, just google for ""airbnb custom spaces"" to see pics. I love bringing people to the office because they always like it. In terms of the job itself, it's very reasonable, flexible hours, only occasionally work late when I choose to, supportive and helpful team. All in all, there's nothing that I really dislike about Airbnb.","I would definitely say the company has more focus on product development and growth, than on engineering quality. That means that currently the code base is a little messy, and there are times where you'll have to ask a few people before you find someone who understands the code well. However, this is definitely being worked on as we expand, and different components are being refactored or rewritten. Also, I feel that designers get too much say in the things that are built, occasionally at the expense of functionality."

What I've loved is that we're always looking to improve, or make our processes more efficient, and to grow personally, but that can be exhausting for some.  Also, we're admittedly a quirky bunch, so to excel here you need to have a sense of humor, and"
So far so good,2015-07-02,"Data Scientist in San Francisco, CA",4,,"- Friendly and welcoming. I eat lunch with a rotating set of people from my department every day. It's easy to get to know your colleagues.  - Cool office and free food. - Interesting projects to work on, and generally good support to find the resources you need.","- Understaffed. They're growing quickly so there are a lot of new people, and even more work than we can handle. Even so, work/life balance has been ok, mostly because they're really flexible and not a face-time culture. But there's a lot to do."
Life Changing,2015-04-13,"Trust and Safety Investigator in Portland, OR",5,,"The pros are too long to list. If you enjoy being part of building a company or continuing to learn new skills this is your company.  Also, by far the greatest group of people in the best work environment I can imagine.","It's really hard to find a con in this company. Nothing is perfect and you can't expect Airbnb to be any different.  If anything, it's work/life balance but if you enjoy what you are doing, it doesn't feel like work."
Look forward to work every single day,2016-07-29,"Data Scientist in San Francisco, CA",5,,"The people at Airbnb are amazing- everyone is genuinely smart, enthusiastic, and friendly.

Hypocritical culture/broken middle management/no work life blanace,2018-01-11,"Anonymous Employee in San Francisco, CA",1,,Smart and talented colleagues  Good mission Interesting product and problem to work on,"Culture is hypocritical- the founders might not mean to have the culture become what it is today but reality is that people only being a host to manage up. The outside image and recruiting brand definitely looks much better than the reality inside. They recently cut the food team while taking about the brand of AIRFAM when recruiting - no family is disposable for financial reasons, if you cannot stand for your culture then do not say or brand it.  Broken operation - I have been working for several tech companies big and small, the management at Airbnb is definitely on the chaotic side. Teams step on each others’ toes, nonsense frequent reorganization, people get promoted by taking others’ credit. Mid management focus on growing their own career here rather than helping team or their reports be successful. Setting up your authority in the organization or being an early employee is more important than doing actual impactful work. Many managers promoted within the company from early days do not know how to manage and often meddle with employee’s work.  Lack of innovation - most of middle management here, as a result of trying to promote their own career, do not take bold innovative approach to the business. The result is a lack of innovation to make impact but rather fine tuning to make their performance review looks good or please their upper management.  No work life balance - you are expected to work A LOT sometimes 70-80 hours when you are on certain teams."
Can't imagine a better place to work,2014-12-10,"Talent in San Francisco, CA",5,,"The culture here is really incredible and really underhyped. It's hard to imagine working somewhere with happier, nicer people all around. People here really care about the product and making it better, people usually leave between 5 and 7PM, the office is amazing to come to every day, and it seems like people genuinely love their jobs. It's really impressive that Airbnb has kept the culture so strong with such fast growth.",The facilities could definitely be improved and hopefully opening the 3rd floor will make things better but there's no place to make a call or take a meeting!
Awesome place to work,2015-01-09,"Data Scientist in San Francisco, CA",5,,"- The most positive, self-motivated co-workers I've ever met - Great perks - food, massages, PTO, winter shut down, travel coupon, ability to work remotely at times - Flexibility and trust to do the right thing from management - Management genuinely cares about our users and think of them as partners, not dollar signs. When our users do well, we do well. It's nice to not be in an ""us vs them"" situation.","- Challenges associated with a fast-growing company. Crowded, noisy office."

Best damn job I've ever had...,2015-02-12,"Customer Experience Specialist in Portland, OR",5,,"Airbnb focuses a lot on company culture. I work with friends, which generates an open environment for me to be my best self and put my best ideas forward. I feel respected by my colleagues, and I feel taken care of by my workplace. We have a world class food program, travel credits, enough time-off, and a beautiful workspace to call home. Our leaders are approachable and want to work with the ""troops on the ground"" to ensure our product works.",Work/life balance can be a real struggle.

At Home,2015-01-09,"Software Engineer in San Francisco, CA",5,,"Airbnb is the type of place that if it fits with you, then it *really* fits. The co-workers are incredibly fun, interesting, talented people who have a lot of stories to share. I always feel at home coming in to the office.  Great culture and generally a pleasant place to be. As an engineer, there is a good amount of challenge.","The culture can lead to long work hours. It's mostly because people are passionate about what they do, but it can make it feel like late nights are expected even if they're not."
Great place to work if you want ownership and license/agency,2015-02-02,"Software Engineer in San Francisco, CA",5,,"Agency: if you see a gap, you can fill it. Several of our teams have been formed by a couple engineers deciding that something needs to be improved, and rather than telling management that there is a need, they just filled the need themselves.","For a lot of engineers, the tendency is to automate everything. It can require a fair bit of discipline to do things that don't scale, but at this stage of the company's growth, the opportunity cost of working on automation for a couple weeks can be significant."

Unfit Management,2017-06-02,"Data Scientist in San Francisco, CA",1,,Free food and good people.,"There is a lot of chaos and shifting priorities everyday. Managers are homegrown and don't really know how to manage. They are mainly concerned with upward management and don't invest in developing employees. Also, a culture which values visibility and ""tooting your own horn"" over genuine hard work. A very weak data science foundation that is bound to collapse sooner or later unless something is done about it."
Great culture but with weak leadership and some bad apples,2020-06-21,"Data Scientist in San Francisco, CA",4,,- Company takes care of you.  - Work life balance can be achieved without too much pressure. - Smart colleagues,"- Leadership and middle management mostly unvetted with little experience.  - Self-promotion leading to unideal outcomes for users and the company (eg., tech debt, not telling full view of results).  - Cutting corners leads to long term costs and over-hiring of teams to maintain unmaintainable systems. - Poor feedback loop means managers and leaders are left not accountable."
Inspiring!,2015-02-12,"Employee Experience in San Francisco, CA",5,,"Everyday I feel beyond lucky to work at a company with such an incredible culture and wonderful people. I am so inspired by the work I am involved with and constantly amazed by the caliber of my colleagues. Creativity is central, and rethinking status quo is standard. Airbnb is a mission-driven organization and you can directly see the value of your contributions to big and impactful goals.","The work can be utterly addicting. There is still very much a start-up culture and each person could easily be replaced by three. Most people here log long hours, but it's of our own choosing."
Beware of the health insurance,2015-12-22,"Software Engineer in San Francisco, CA",2,,Positive culture Fast pace of growth great mission Excellent people,"Check the fine print on the benefits if you are coming from another tech company. Especially if you have or planning to have a family and need good health insurance. That was the biggest surprise for me, and will probably be one of the reasons I decide to eventually leave."
Culture can be too much,2018-02-14,"Engineer in San Francisco, CA",4,,"Culture, you might never feel mistreated.","Culture, when it is too much, it is a burden. When someone did something wrong, no one will point it out or blame the person, instead, the people who take it too serious might be blamed and in trouble. This makes decision making and pushing project super hard some times."

Some of my best friends I've made at Airbnb, and it's always fun to come in to work. Our core values help to really allow you to work with people that you like being around. Additionally, everyone really believes in the mission of the company and want to make a difference, so you never feel like a cog in some larger machine.

People are very talented, especially the creatives. Great benefits include free food (breakfast, lunch and dinner), snacks, company-paid healthcare, etc. Plus there's even an espresso machine for employee use!","The company is still trying to catch up to its exponential growth. Groups can still improve on communicating and working more closely together, and there are ongoing efforts to do so."
A Community,2015-02-12,"Trust and Safety Investigator in Portland, OR",5,,"Airbnb has all of the perks typically found in the tech industry, but with a focus on quality, health, integrity, sustainability, etc. Kitchen staff is in house and enjoys all perks of company.  Fast growing company with lots of opportunity.  Management deals with opportunities for improvement proactively and makes changes.","Growing so quickly, often opportunities precede tenure. Departments can be siloed and with the company becoming larger, communication and collaboration can at times be lacking."
Great Company. Culture at Risk.,2018-07-05,"Management in San Francisco, CA",3,,"Smart, mission-driven, committed employees. Beautiful physical work environment. Amazing food. Interesting, challenging work.","Chaotic, undisciplined decision-making. Grueling pace. Too little emphasis on hiring and developing great leaders. The executive team lacks cohesiveness.

How I started at airbnb,2017-03-31,"Anonymous Employee in San Francisco, CA",5,,"- Good people. Seems small, but it makes a difference. - Focus on community, not competition. - Wonderful office.",- It was a long process. (1 - 2 months) - It was unclear at times how I was doing in the process - There were many interviews. 6+
Peers and great. Management is not.,2018-01-24,"Anonymous Employee in Portland, OR",3,,Best peer support of any company I have ever worked for. Best offices. Design is key but can sometimes be form over function.,Management is not empowered and makes the job worse and slow. Middle management unnecessarily slows work and is bloated. Management is not trained and is biggest issue.
Incredible work environment,2014-11-02,"Software Engineer in San Francisco, CA",5,,"I love coming to work everyday. The people are great, the food is delicious, and best of all what we're working on is inspiring. The office is beautiful and a pleasure to be in and the company has maintained a great culture despite growing so quickly.",The building is still being renovated so there is some construction noise and work space is limited. When the rest of the building opens up things should be much better.
Great starting position... Not great advancement opportunity,2019-08-03,"Community Organizer in South San Francisco, CA",5,,"Perfect for those who like to travel and have a flexible schedule.

Having fun and solving problems!,2014-11-04,"Anonymous Employee in San Francisco, CA",5,,"An incredibly supportive environment. Co-workers and head honchos make time to talk with you about your projects and ideas. A really happy employee base fueled by delicious food, challenging problems, and a beautiful workspace.

Amazing culture and people,2014-12-10,"in San Francisco, CA",5,,"I have never worked anywhere where people are so passionate and inspired by what we do and what we stand for. Overwhelmingly positive culture and inspirational leadership. I am excited to come to work every day. I've never been happier at a job, and I know many of my colleagues feel the same way.",Can't think of any at this time.
Poor and ineffective management,2016-12-24,"Anonymous Employee in San Francisco, CA",1,,"- Good healthy food - Superbly designed office space, esp. conference rooms","- Inexperienced and clueless managers who rarely spent any time understanding employee's career path, projects, etc. and jumped to conclusions without fully investigating issues - Random project prioritization again stemming from poor management - Constant visitors, randomly taking pics and shooting videos, standups in the aisle makes really difficult for people to focus on their work - The company keeps talking about culture but rarely seems to investigate employee happiness and satisfaction."
An Inspiring Place to Work,2016-01-26,"Anonymous Employee in San Francisco, CA",4,,Airbnb is a challenging and stimulating place to go everyday. The vibe is very social and there are many people I'm excited to speak to everyday. One must believe in the company's mission to thrive in such a demanding environment.,Work/ life balance is a joke. You must have a passion and integration for what you do and who you are to work here. The company is growing very quickly and the lack of organization reflects that.
"Growing pains, not all that glitters is gold",2016-12-11,"Anonymous Employee in San Francisco, CA",1,,-- Great brand that constantly attracts top talent -- Growing at fast pace -- Bold mission -- Beautiful office,"-- Lots of people are here for the wrong reasons. Whether people want to admit it or not, countless people are here for the equity, and won't hesitate to jump ship when things go south. There are prank emails titled ""Important IPO Update"" to get people's attention; I've overheard countless conversations with people 1) reminiscing about their old company and not willing to leave until they vest, 2) not being truly passionate about the product, or 3) directly comparing how much equity they got. The IPO is a constant question that's asked during all-hands and is frequently the most upvoted. -- The Kool-Aid here is stronger than ever. Buy into the cult or leave. A ton of people are hesitant or afraid to tell upper management about what they don't like about recent/upcoming product(s) such as Magical Trips. Several coworkers whom I've talked to and I have been part of conversations (even involving middle management) where people have openly voiced their concerns or complaints. -- Really poor transparency. Political. Depends on your team and YMMV. Your manager may verbally tell you that you're doing great and dole out compliments every so often, but you may be shocked when your performance reviews come out.  -- ""Culture"" can be described as how well you embody the company's mission and core values, and is ridiculously subjective. Lots of talented people don't make the cut because they failed to make a good impression on the core values interviews. It's Airbnb's way of weeding out people who aren't a ""good fit"" for their clique. -- Very cliquey, feels like a frat. If you fit in, you'll like it. If you don't, you won't. Emphasis on drinking at company events. Overheard multiple people on different occasions making straight up sexist remarks during and after work. -- Poor work-life balance. People appear happy-go-lucky but many are in fact stressed out. Lyft drivers often tell me how people complain about work. Coworkers I've talked to complain about the constant pressure to do well for performance evaluations. -- Lots and lots of growing pains.  Honestly not at all surprised they plunged to #35 on Glassdoor."
Great community oriented company,2020-02-19,"Sales Executive in New York, NY",4,,Great culture and focus on community and society. Many different teams and areas to develop your interests and grow your strengths. Great benefits and perks if you are working in one of the main offices or based in SF.,With an IPO in the future there is a lot of red tape that requires extensive time to get things done with lots of hands involved in the pot. Not the same perks and opportunities when based in a remote office or working remotely.

Hypocritical culture/broken middle management/no work life blanace,2018-01-11,"Anonymous Employee in San Francisco, CA",1,,Smart and talented colleagues  Good mission Interesting product and problem to work on,"Culture is hypocritical- the founders might not mean to have the culture become what it is today but reality is that people only being a host to manage up. The outside image and recruiting brand definitely looks much better than the reality inside. They recently cut the food team while taking about the brand of AIRFAM when recruiting - no family is disposable for financial reasons, if you cannot stand for your culture then do not say or brand it.  Broken operation - I have been working for several tech companies big and small, the management at Airbnb is definitely on the chaotic side. Teams step on each others’ toes, nonsense frequent reorganization, people get promoted by taking others’ credit. Mid management focus on growing their own career here rather than helping team or their reports be successful. Setting up your authority in the organization or being an early employee is more important than doing actual impactful work. Many managers promoted within the company from early days do not know how to manage and often meddle with employee’s work.  Lack of innovation - most of middle management here, as a result of trying to promote their own career, do not take bold innovative approach to the business. The result is a lack of innovation to make impact but rather fine tuning to make their performance review looks good or please their upper management.  No work life balance - you are expected to work A LOT sometimes 70-80 hours when you are on certain teams."

Unfit Management,2017-06-02,"Data Scientist in San Francisco, CA",1,,Free food and good people.,"There is a lot of chaos and shifting priorities everyday. Managers are homegrown and don't really know how to manage. They are mainly concerned with upward management and don't invest in developing employees. Also, a culture which values visibility and ""tooting your own horn"" over genuine hard work. A very weak data science foundation that is bound to collapse sooner or later unless something is done about it."
Great culture but with weak leadership and some bad apples,2020-06-21,"Data Scientist in San Francisco, CA",4,,- Company takes care of you.  - Work life balance can be achieved without too much pressure. - Smart colleagues,"- Leadership and middle management mostly unvetted with little experience.  - Self-promotion leading to unideal outcomes for users and the company (eg., tech debt, not telling full view of results).  - Cutting corners leads to long term costs and over-hiring of teams to maintain unmaintainable systems. - Poor feedback loop means managers and leaders are left not accountable."

Culture can be too much,2018-02-14,"Engineer in San Francisco, CA",4,,"Culture, you might never feel mistreated.","Culture, when it is too much, it is a burden. When someone did something wrong, no one will point it out or blame the person, instead, the people who take it too serious might be blamed and in trouble.
