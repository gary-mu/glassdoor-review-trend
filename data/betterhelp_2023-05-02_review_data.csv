Supplimental Work From Home,2023-04-17,"Counselor in New Orleans, LA",5,,"Self paced, self directed work with user friendly website and colleague support","Lower pay, challenge when clients would benefit from face to face treatment"
Really amazing place to work!,2023-03-28,"Senior Engineer in Mountain View, CA",5,,"Wonderfully friendly group of people! I've made a ton of great friends here. There is a lot of freedom in projects, room to grow. Very open to feedback about code. Managers are all great listeners and really seem to have their employees best interest at heart. The benefits are really great too!","There is very little help from the company with the direction of one's career growth. Also, even though there is usually a lot of freedom to choose what you work on, it's possible to get pigeonholed within a single feature for a long time. I know they are working on fixing both of these issues though, and they're very receptive to feedback."
Very exploitative,2023-04-22,"Therapist in New York, NY",2,,Seeing a range of clients,No protection for late cancels or no-shows . Hourly rate goes down when hours go down. BH sends less clients to force people to work less hours b/c it's cheaper for them.
Easy to use platform,2023-04-10,Anonymous Employee,5,,Very easy to use platform.,Can be difficult to maintain a particular amount of hours per week.
So far so good!,2023-03-14,Software Engineer,5,,"Really welcoming environment. Management will do anything they can to help support staff whether that is with equipment, software, time off, perks, etc. BetterHelp is a company that actually live their values rather than just paying lip service. I feel very fortunate to work here.",Interview process is long (but totally worth it).
Employee review,2023-03-14,"Therapist in Temecula, CA",4,,- Convenient as remote therapist form home. - Reasonably easy to navigate platform in communicating with clients - Flexible workload as much as you choose to add new clients,"- Hourly pay could be better - Few incentives, like paid CEU trainings or licensure reimbursement - Client matching not the best"
BetterHelp review,2023-04-16,"Therapist in Atlanta, GA",2,,Low stress paperwork; good place to improve your skills,"Poor back end office support, poor compensation for training level of therapist"
Below average pay,2023-04-17,"Counselor in Springfield, MO",2,,You quickly get a case load and can get busy fast.,Pay is just not worth the time and effort.
Lack of Boundaries with company and clients,2023-04-11,"Therapist in Los Angeles, CA",1,,You can make your own schedule,"Poor pay, lack of live support, poor boundaries, lack of any knowledge of client information necessary to do good therapy, makes you interact with clients during off hours, cuts you off if you are not available at all times."

"Easy platform, low pay",2023-03-14,"Psychotherapist in Mountain View, CA",2,,Platform is easy to use and therapists don’t have to worry about paperwork or billing.,The pay if one only has a few clients is ridiculously low!
Draining and tiring work environment,2023-02-16,"Member Success Advocate in Mountain View, CA",1,,Remote work from home and nice perks,Lack of communication between employees and upper management Very draining and always felt like there was more work than employees
Good environment for work,2023-02-08,Privacy Manager,5,,Having a sense of teamwork while working remotely.,No Cons for now. Just good environment to work.
Chasing the next feature is slowly killing the organization,2022-02-15,"Senior Systems Administrator in Sunnyvale, CA",3,,"Pay was decent, when everything went work from home the company honored the agreement to feed its employees with generous uber eats accounts.  Alon gracefully handles very hard, very pointed questions and answers to the best that can be expected.","The management has very little understanding of the current state of the art for security, application design, and technology innovation. Instead focusing on chasing feature after feature, they choose not to invest in paying down technical debt or improving the long term maintainability of systems or implementing basic security features such as MFA.  They also take a very lax approach to regulatory compliance and the advice of staff clinicians for what is clinically best; while correct to the letter of the law leaves employees with a strong sense of do-the-right-thing feeling left out in the cold.  Overall when I left there was also a feeling that Teladoc (parent company) was starting to exert its influence directly rather than keeping an arm's length from something that was working. Teladoc has less than zero idea how to operate in a startup environment and was asking for things that made no sense at a technical level and were harmful at an organizational culture level."
Therapist onboarding specialist,2022-11-21,"Counselor Onboarding Specialist in Mountain View, CA",4,,"good benefits, great work evironment","low pay, no room for growth"
Meaningful Experience,2022-06-18,"Anonymous Employee in Mountain View, CA",5,,"Working at BetterHelp is a meaningful experience. I feel valued for my work, and I love my co-workers. The team truly cares about our members and ensuring that therapy is accessible, affordable and convenient for everyone.   Our leadership team is transparent and there are many opportunities to grow within the company.  And, while we're owned by Teladoc health and that has some disadvantages (like bigger company workflows), the pros outweigh the cons - like generous fertility benefits, free Teladoc services, 401k matching, RSUs and ESPP.","Working at BetterHelp is like working at a startup so the expectation is that you wear many hats. It's not a con, it's just worth noting because the culture may not be everyone."
Cannot Believe I Landed This Job,2022-03-18,"Marketing Administrator in Mountain View, CA",5,,"--The benefits and perks of working here are enormous! They definitely take care of their employees and prioritize the person over the work. This person-centric focus contributes to the overall culture. --Unlimited PTO is recognized and used frequently by the employees. --A culture that prioritizes community and togetherness. I value my coworkers as my peers, but also as my friends.  --They are extremely conscious of workload. Consistently checking in to make sure I'm not overwhelmed, but I'm also definitely never bored. This does feed into a culture that values proactivity, however. You don't typically get assigned tasks, rather, you ask to work on the things that you're interested in. It's your responsibility to monitor your own workload and make sure you're not taking on too much.","istently checking in to make sure I'm not overwhelmed, but I'm also definitely never bored.

Fast-paced startup culture with great perks,2022-01-25,"Marketing Manager in Mountain View, CA",4,,"Betterhelp is a great place to progress your career in a fast-paced growth environment. The company has increased headcount 30% in the last half year which is a great sign. The people I've had the pleasure of meeting or working with cross functionally are brilliant, diverse and talented individuals. People culture and perks are great, however work can be grueling and demanding.","This might depend on the team, but despite all the headcount growth and the fact that we're over 200 people, it's still very challenging to track down the right person or team to help you with something, and it takes a while to execute on projects both small and large. Definitely startup culture. I find myself working over 40 hours/week consistently and will get emails and slacks from manager on the weekends. If work/life balance is your #1 important aspect of your professional life, make sure you set boundaries and vet this during interviews."
Mission + Management + Coworkers,2022-03-29,"Full Stack Engineer in Mountain View, CA",5,,"- Support from seniors and other coworkers is strong, I'm learning a ton - Engineering management is excellent, they provide the right amount of oversight without micromanaging - Company culture is great, very relaxed yet fun to be part of - Benefits are excellent - Company is doing _very_ well, and it reflects in the treatment they return to the employees","- Tech stack is a bit antiquated, could hurt next job prospects if I had to leave the job with BetterHelp (This is being worked on though) - Options to stay fully remote remain ambiguous, though it may work out that way as more and more waves of covid hit"
They Spoil Us!,2022-03-18,Senior Therapist Recruiter,5,,"The perks and treatment of their employees are way above and beyond anywhere I have worked. I have had some pretty amazing perks with previous companies, but Betterhelp's is through the roof. $550 a month in uber eats, free massages, fruit delivery, haircuts, its crazy how much they provide for their people.","They are owned by Teladoc, which is huge company and leads to communication issues. Onboarding took an extra two weeks before I could access benefits and just be fully setup as an employee. Also, did not get first paycheck for several pay periods. I had money saved, but the guy that started with me was the only provider in his family and that was a little struggle for them."
Great company and culture,2022-06-29,Anonymous Employee,5,,"Great perks and benefits, can have any equipment you need","Different teams are treated differently, some very happy and some not"
A dream come true!,2022-03-31,"Talent Team in San Francisco, CA",5,,"I really enjoy working at BetterHelp. It is a tight knit group and everyone supports each other to succeed! You get tons of hands on experience and challenging problems to work with. The leadership is also very supportive of the team - I feel like I am genuinely appreciated and heard! Lastly, it is so refreshing to see such a diverse group of individuals!",Nothing as of yet - I will edit this comment once I get a better feel of the company.
Amazing company & work culture,2022-03-29,Product Manager,5,,"This company is a silicon valley dream come true.  Working at BetterHelp gives you an amazing opportunity to make an impact at a high growth tech startup. The company has an awesome work culture & a leadership team that is highly supportive of their team.  The compensation is pretty solid, and the perks are amazing.",The stock (RSU comp) is extremely volatile right now.
Great Mission and Culture,2022-03-22,"Anonymous Employee in Mountain View, CA",5,,"The team at BetterHelp is really passionate and bright. Everyone is a pleasure to work with and the overall culture is top-tier. It's still a pretty fast-paced, ""start-up"" environment, which I feel gives everyone a ton a room for growth. They prefer to promote internally. We're also pretty spoiled with all of our perks and team/company-wide events.","Leadership can be a bit too hands-on at time, which can slow things down."
An amazing organization,2022-03-25,Anonymous Employee,5,,Extremely caring people who believe in the company's mission. BetterHelp has such a great culture despite many virtual employees such as myself. The new hire onboarding experience was seamless and I've had great mentorship. You will have great opportunities to interact and engage with all levels of leadership. You will have high-impact and high-visibility in any role at this exciting company.,None. It is such a great place to work.
Great place to work for new graduates,2022-03-30,"Data Scientist in Mountain View, CA",4,,"great teammates, great diversity of culture and amazing perks","The company is growing so fast, and now about more than half of the team joined within 6 months. The learning process is almost continuous all the time. But it's actually very helpful for career growth for new graduates like me."

Great people make a great company,2021-11-01,Principal Software Engineer,5,,Every person I have encountered at BetterHelp has proven to be talented and extremely easy to work with. There is no perceivable management hierarchy to get in the way and there are no egos... everybody is accessible and focused on moving the platform forward.,There is no place to hide or progress by simply talking and making pretty charts. Everybody.. and I do mean everybody... works on real customer facing deliverables every day.

Amazing Place to Work!,2021-10-12,Full Stack Web Developer,5,,"Incredible company culture! This is a real team where everyone supports and values one another. Every single interaction I've had with a teammate has been positive -- even when I've messed something up, the response is always understanding and encouragement. The benefits and compensation are absolutely extraordinary, but you can't put a price on having a work family like this one.","No major cons.

Best work-life balance,2021-10-26,Marketing Administrator,5,,"Community of people who care about the business and increasing access to mental health support. Culture that is focused on making sure each employee is satisfied with the work they are doing, and have healthy work-life balance. A start-up culture in a bigger, funded company.

It's also a very talented team: expect to be challenged to keep learning and to continually improve.","It's a rapidly growing company, so sometimes there are signs of growing pains with such a high proportion of the workforce being fairly new.

Making the world a better place.,2021-04-06,"Senior Therapist Recruiter in Mountain View, CA",5,,"A mission that makes waking up and getting at it very easy.  Amazing leadership from the top down. Part of a larger organization but feels like working for a fast-growing start-up.  Very generous company. Colleagues are smart, ambitious, and all-around great people.","Lots to do and not enough hours in the day to get everything done. But when you love what you do, it's all about having proper work boundaries."
"Some great people, but overall a toxic environment",2021-07-10,"Software Engineer in Sunnyvale, CA",2,,"Some great colleagues Perks were great, esp. the lunches Compensation was competitive","Toxic office culture, coming straight down from the CEO. CEO is just plain rude to people at times, and is a bit of a narcissist to be honest. They have a lot of technical debt, and there is no will to refactor. This means new features are hard to build quickly and reliably. Tech stack is outdated."

Management is focused on making sure our clients get the best help possible over making another dollar out of them. This is definitely refreshing!,"Still new in the company, haven't found any real cons!"
Poor work/life balance,2021-03-09,"Community and Support Manager in Sunnyvale, CA",1,,"*Good people: When I was there, there were a lot of quality people on many teams. They were friendly, hard working, and supportive","* Constant internal evaluations of work: Monthly or quarterly internal evaluations of ones work can be very beneficial. However, we were evaluated weekly across multiple points such as accuracy, time per ticket, customer satisfaction rating, content of reply, ect. So much evaluation creates constant pressure on a team and results in increased stress *Individual contributor tickets completed per day goal far exceeded industry standards and promoted working off the clock *More senior to the team coworkers were let go under vague circumstances leaving the team stressed about their own security  *Leadership was unconcerned about the stress the team was under *Leadership had no clear career growth for support team,"
Great company - great culture,2021-04-27,"Data Science in Mountain View, CA",5,,"Great colleagues, fast face, mission driven",Pain associated with exponential growth
Amazing support!,2020-10-14,"Member Success in Mountain View, CA",5,,"You are always heard and never judged. As they are a company under Teladoc, your health comes first!

A company that cares,2020-06-23,Junior QA Engineer,5,,"Quarantine Uber Eats, work from home stipend, and genuine interest from management about new ideas are just some of the reasons BetterHelp stands out as a great place to work. BetterHelp understands that its workforce is made up of individuals and treats them as such. Team morale always seems to be at the forefront of company decisions.  While I would expect nothing less from a company in this business, the mental health of BetterHelp's employees seems to be a priority.","I began employment in the middle of quarantine and if I had a problem, it was sometimes difficult to know who had the expertise to help me solve my problem. As someone fairly social for a software engineer, I can see this being a difficult process for new employees who are shy.  BetterHelp also doesn't have the highest salaries in the Bay and they know it. If a high salary is your #1 priority, look elsewhere."
You want this!,2020-06-23,"CISO in Mountain View, CA",5,,"The staff are all friendly and are close to each other. As a small company, it feels very intimate and your voice is heard. Everyone wants to help each other and act as a team to continuously improve the organization with so much pride. We have team activities such as video games that bring us closer. When first starting, I was able to meet everyone through these fun team building exercises. The business is in the perfect position in the industry due to the current shelter in place conditions. While other companies are reducing staff and production, demand for BetterHelp's platform has been very positive and incredible. I highly recommend joining BetterHelp as you will not regret it and wonder why you didn't do so earlier.","Only con is not looking into BetterHelp earlier. There are some growing pains as is typical for companies this size resulting in a very busy staff. However, this means that we are growing instead of the opposite direction."
Great product and Work Environment,2020-06-18,"Workplace Manager in Mountain View, CA",5,,I am new to the company but so far my experience here has exceeded my expectations. Joining a new company is hard-especially during SIP-but I can truly say that BetterHelp is doing their best to set up new hires to be successful. This extends to all their employees. Not just ensuring that we are productive but that we are able to navigate through this new WFH situation as best as possible. Benefits such as Uber Eats credits and WFH stipends are all great but taking time out of our company wide meeting to take a stretch and breathing course and giving an extra company wide holiday really depicts how they care for the well being of their employees. I am very excited to get to grow with BetterHelp!,Fast growing start up. There is no time for hand holding. Days can be long and fast pace. If you do not thrive in this type of environment I would reconsider.
Better Employment,2017-11-14,Anonymous Employee,4,,"Great office culture of work-life balance. This includes flexibility, understanding, and compassion. Management is made of real people that take into consideration that employees are also real people with real life issues outside of work sometimes. Plenty of office events, celebrations, and activities to keep us happy and motivated. Lots of things going on to remind us what a great service we are building. An environment is curated here that you feel heard, that your ideas amount to something, and the work you put in directly affects the platform.","When it rains, it pours. This isn't about BetterHelp specifically, but just start ups in general. When we're busy, we're really busy, meaning sometimes we work some long days/evenings. It gets really cold in the office sometimes."
Awesome place for providing help to those who need it,2017-04-01,,5,,"1. Compared to other platforms, BetterHelp has the most options for any kind of expertise and service offered.  2. It's the most robust (and oldest?) player in the market which is very assuring when working in the mental health field.","1. The platform is constantly changing which often creates confusion and concerns among providers. 2. While pay is fair, it still doesn't compare to private practice rates."
"Important mission, impactful work and good culture",2019-08-29,"Employee in Sunnyvale, CA",5,,"Company has a great mission and really helps a lot of people. It's obvious from all the reviews that come in. Company also has a fun and friendly culture with great people. If you are self motivated and ok with fast pace and less structure, you can do very well.","Feels like a startup without a lot of structure which can be hard for some people. Depending on your role, it can sometimes be hard to know if you are doing well."
Changing the world one person at a time.,2017-11-13,"Anonymous Employee in Sunnyvale, CA",5,,"When I tell stories to my relatives and friends working outside silicon valley they can't believe a place like this exists. Betterhelp bends over backwards to foster community and keep it's exceptionally skilled team intact and pushing forward toward it's lofty goals. This small but close knit group has accomplished more in the past year than competitors 10x our size and we have made meaningful impacts in countless peoples lives as a result of the platform and network of professionals we've developed. This is the place where you can have a real impact and grow both professionally and personally. The work is challenging and there are moments of high stress but they are tempered with recognition and accomplishment in a balanced way. We get free lunches daily, free door dash if you are working late, we have hammocks and massage chairs, a $2000 coffeemaker and all Chromatic coffee you can drink, beers are in the fridge, the break room snacks are never lacking and so long as you get your work done no one seems to care about the specific hours you are at your fancy standing desk. It's a fantastic company and you will be lucky if you make through rigorous interview process and onto the team. It's worth the effort.","You have to be a self starter. If you are someone that needs to wait to be told what and how to do things, then this is not the place for you."

Betterhelp pros and cos,2023-03-21,"Online Counsellor in London, England",4,,BetterHelp provide you the counsellor with online clients who complete a brief summary of why they are seeking help. You are given a schedule to update with times available. Contact with the client is made through the BetterHelp portal and you can send text messages as well. Payment is made on a Wednesday for the previous week’s work.,"You do feel you are working in a vacuum. No idea how much the client is paying. You cannot book a session at short notice, like the same day. I offer 20 or more hours of available slots, but only have 5 or 6 clients. I am paid about £20 each session – that is 45 minutes online, write up time for notes, preparation and if a client DNA you are not paid. Then you get a message to say Client X is no longer a subscriber. What does that mean? They did not like you, they felt fully recovered, maybe they went to another BetterHelp counsellor."
