Grow therapy,2023-03-06,"Therapist in Los Angeles, CA",5,,"I have nothing bad to say about my experience with Grow Therapy. It allows therapists to do what they love (therapy) while taking care of the administrative stuff that most therapists do not enjoy and as such we are able to focus our energy on the clients rather than worry about billing, credentialing, etc. They are very supportive of their staff and are very prompt to answer any questions you might have. In most instances, the response has been immediately or less than 1/2 hour. They have many events you can attend to get familiar with the software, get to know other staff, and be supported by other therapists as well. I love that they have a social hour that allows us to get to know each other and not feel isolated. I am also enjoying the clients through this platform as they seems to be more committed to their goals and put in the effort.",I wish I could decide when I wanted to get paid. You basically get paid every Monday but I guess that is not a bad thing if you get broke soon :)

A Dream Come True,2022-12-18,"Licensed Clinical Professional Counselor in Carlsbad, CA",5,,"Contracting with Grow Therapy has been a dream come true for me. I had a 6 month plan to see clients through Grow on weekends and in the evenings, and just 3 weeks after starting to take referrals my private practice is thriving to the point where I am able to leave my very stressful 9-5 job and commit to my private practice full time! Grow has made everything easy! Honestly if I had to do my own marketing, scheduling, and billing I think I would be completely overwhelmed with the administrative side of things and would not be able to so enthusiastically support so many clients. When I first started looking in to contracting with Grow and was reading practitioners' reviews I kept saying to myself this is just too good to be true. I still say this to myself every single day! And then I remind myself that it is really happening!",I wish Grow was able to offer me affordable health insurance.

Great company partner.,2023-02-02,"Paychotherapist in Los Angeles, CA",5,,"I have been very happy partnering with Grow Therapy. It does require clients to choose you as a therapist, but I have received many clients from Grow. Expect your caseload to take a few months (3-7mon) to build your practice into a full time gig. If you are ready for slow and steady building of a client base, this company partner is for you.",None the I have encountered.

Excellent place to work,2022-12-12,"Therapist in Sacramento, CA",5,,"I enjoy the Circle community, my caseload has grown very quickly, I was credentialed very quickly with a number of insurance providers and from the start (recruitment until now) customer service has been top tier (especially quick email responses).

I love being a part of the GROW community.
Couldn't have done it without Grow,2023-01-23,Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist (LMFT),5,,Grow has been amazingly helpful; in starting my practice. I was onboarded and started seeing patients within 2 months (and a large part of that was simply due to the holidays). I stand by that Grow was truly made for therapists. I tried other similar platforms and they were not nearly as supportive of the therapists.,My only downside is not receiving as many in-person referrals as I would like.
Look No Further,2022-12-16,Licensed Clinical Social Worker LCSW,5,,"The best reasons are ease, connection and autonomy. Truly they make the paperwork, easy! The platform is user friendly. We also have a community that is very connected (even though we are all over the US) via an app that functions similar to FaceBook. We can refer to each other, ask opinions or treatment suggestions. Lastly, you work for you! Grow just takes care of the parts that make growing your practice, enjoyable.",Some kinks are still being worked out with the Grow platform. I don’t have any complaints but occasionally you hear of someone trying to fix an issue with how the platform functions or what it offers.
Great way to practice independently,2022-12-18,Mental Health Counselor/Psychotherapist,5,,"Grow is constantly improving their platform. They are extremely supportive and informative and seem to be available 7 days a week. Sometimes, they even answer a question within one hour on a Sunday. Scheduling has become much easier. Submitting invoices is a breeze. The company put us on ZocDoc and will expand marketing. I have thought of going out on my own but why bother? Grow does everything for you and it the best pay of any online company.",A learning curve like anything but there are great videos and support chat.

The pay is good and the company is awesome to work for!,The only con I have found it the note taking is a little confusing but it gets easier as you go.
