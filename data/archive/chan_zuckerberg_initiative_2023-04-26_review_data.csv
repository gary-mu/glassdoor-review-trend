"Meaningful, mission-oriented work",2023-02-08,Anonymous Employee,5,,100% 401k match Healthcare Vacation,Nothing comes in mind currently
CZI,2022-08-19,Anonymous Employee,5,,"1. Mission driven 2. great culture 3. Talented people , lots to learn from a diverse group.",Nothing major that I can think of.
That's showbiz baby!,2022-12-21,Anonymous Employee,2,,"Very strong benefits and onsite perks. Attracts a lot of people who want to make an impact, so at least you'll all be frustrated together.","CZI is philanthropy theater.   The CEO wants to be and be seen as a philanthropist. This explains many/most decisions, like why she is the CEO, the lack of accountability for failure, reduction in spending *only to increase operating time*, and the empty mission statements that sound good but don't hold up to any scrutiny. (Cure all disease with $50 billion over 80 years? That's the annual NIH budget. Eliminate disparity in academic outcomes? Then why are grants and solutions de-emphasizing outcomes, or outright ignoring them?)  In general, acting like CZI is creating impact is more important than showing impact and learning from mistakes.  (Remainder about the education initiative.)  The principals' attitudes are reflected by most senior leaders.   CZI has spent hundreds of millions (billions?) on an internal program that is no better (and possibly worse!) than alternatives (including the status quo!), yet the response is changing goals and messaging instead of strategy.   There's a lot of circular reasoning; ""the important problems are the ones that can be solved by the solutions we already came up with."" If you ask questions, you get excluded, but if you play along, you get increased scope."
"Flush with resources and good intentions, weak on strategy",2022-11-07,"Director of Engineering in Redwood City, CA",3,,"Vision - CZI has many inspiring goals, and is not afraid to take on very ambitious projects, with little-to-no expectation of generating revenue. Resources - CZI has the resources of a large tech company, and treats its employees as such. Though you're working at a philanthropy, you get many of the perks of a tech company - nice airy offices, the latest equipment, well-stocked kitchens, catered lunches, etc. Talent - CZI has been able to recruit many talented people cutting across a variety of roles, including and especially in software engineering. This is a rare feat for a philanthropy. Work/life balance - Very strong. Many people at CZI have families, and from the beginning the org has been supportive of a good work/life balance. The offices reliably clear out before dinnertime.","CZI has often taken on too much too quickly, and has become a somewhat-bloated organization with too many stakeholders. Due to the easy access to funding, too many new projects get off the ground with insufficient strategic direction or goals. Impressive senior leaders are brought in to fill these gaps in strategy, but they too often aim to solve problems with more hiring. It's a predictible result of an organization with tremendous resources, but without the pressure of having to focus on a sustainable business model."

Like many, I was drawn to the organization for their mission to impact the world, but quickly learned this is not a good place to be. Don’t say you haven’t been warned. Everyone at the company seems dead inside and there’s no culture here because everyone is too afraid to be themselves. Management openly talks bad about other employees. Constant reorgs and firing. Unending bureaucracy. If you enjoy 24/7 politics and watching your back with every move you make, this could be the place for you! It’s too bad because there are a lot of highly accomplished, intelligent people at the company and there’s potential if the environment wasn’t so terrible."
Do Your Best Work For a Better Future,2022-04-01,UX Researcher,5,,"The focus at CZI is really on being empowered to make your work as impactfully as possible. It is a privilege to have your goal truly be doing your best work and growing in your field and not generating a profit. You get to work with brilliant people who celebrate each other as much as the work they do. CZI works hard to provide competitive salaries and benefits. They are always striving to be an industry leader in terms of benefit and compensation strategies. You are supported as a whole person, not just a worker, and that means a lot - generous vacation, support with your life goals, support for those with children, and benefits around supporting a whole you. There is work going on to truly ""walk the walk"" of our organizational values, but it is a genuine effort to do so and not just lip service you would see at a large corporation.","There is a lot of overcommunication from CZI central, but it is the result of people working hard to design a better work environment for us. Overall, I feel very lucky to work here."
Constant changes and stressful environment,2022-11-09,Director,3,,The pay and benefits are very good for the non-tech jobs compared to other places.,"There are constantly changes - priorities, staffing, structure, budgets, systems - that lead to a lot of miscommunication and stress and people acting out of fear."

The managers are like mediocre people who cannot get a better job at other companies, so they come here, do a mediocre job, and just try to hang onto their salary and perhaps advance higher and higher, and with higher pay. It is quite low level."
Disrespected and Diminished: White Privilege and Favoritism Abound at CZI,2020-11-10,Manager,2,,"CZI's social mission; most people are there b/c they really care about making a difference in the world Attracts some great talent: some coworkers are amazing and I love them Anniversary bonuses (almost like a retention bonus -- never heard of a foundation offering these!) Full match on 401k Generous charitable giving match Good performance bonus program Decent catered daily lunch (pre-COVID) Other amazing benefits (bereavement leave, fertility, etc.) Good stepping stone to other places Great place to hunker down during a pandemic - generous leave policy, remote work policy & allowance, etc. We do feel thoughtfully taken care of in this respect.","Mark and Priscilla seem to really genuinely care about their philanthropy, even if at times they still need to learn a lot more about the issue areas they are investing in and be more patient with the pace of social change. While they are fast learners and earnest about the work, similar to other ultra high net worth people, they are surrounded by senior “leaders” who are mostly unwilling to tell them the truth because these leaders are terrified of having their projects and budgets cut. And I say leaders in quotes because real leaders would have the courage to stand their ground and have a shred of integrity.  As a result, CZI is a place that is fraught with politics and a scarcity mindset.   While CZI has attracted some amazing talent, they have not figured out how to fully harness it. In part it may be because turnover is very challenging due to the toxic culture -- the most competent people tend to leave because they have other options (except maybe during a pandemic).   BIPOC staff are unhappy -- it sometimes appears as though significantly less experienced / less qualified / less competent white staff are promoted to higher positions, more quickly (often due to the fact that these staff come from families / backgrounds of privilege and are favored by senior staff, but not because of objective criteria), but no one seems to be allowed to name this phenomenon or the specific individuals. Even though we’re not allowed to talk about these exceptions to the rule, these exceptions are precisely what undercut any real chance of creating an equitable workplace at CZI. Plus everyone whispers about these exceptions and generally knows that these folks are not worthy of their titles.  Often it feels as though, because many of these less qualified white staff manage more competent underlings, the white supervisors feel the need to demean these underlings (perhaps out of a sense of insecurity), which includes throwing them under the bus in front of higher-ups and blaming them when things don’t work out as planned. This makes the environment really toxic, uncollaborative, and political.  This breeds and will continue to breed a lot of resentment, fueling an exodus from CZI and the threat of legal action (as evidenced by the very recent racial discrimination claim filed against CZI and made public by a former colleague)."
Unique place to work but good,2021-04-23,"Senior Software Engineer in Redwood City, CA",5,,Unique and exciting projects Good salary,No equity More meetings than other companies

"If not us, who? If not now, when?",2020-02-25,"Staff Software Engineer in Redwood City, CA",5,,"I want to start this out with the top three reasons why you should not join CZI. As an early nonprofit startup, we do have our fair share of challenges. And the following items are the top ones that I observe:  1. Plenty of changes:  Being a startup, lots of things can be in flux.   Management can change due to the company or the project entering a different phase of cycle (e g., early stage to growth)  Projects are evaluated every 3 to 6 months to determine whether they are worth further investment. Some projects get put on hold and others move to the next phase of the product cycle. (Team members from on hold projects will work on other projects)  Silicon Valley turnover rate (median: one year) applies to CZI as well, but I'd argue our tenure is probably longer  Overall, it's a growing startup, so lots of things are constantly being worked out, while new challenges arise. If you are looking for a predictable and well structured establishment, CZI is not there yet   2. Salary:  CZI is a nonprofit organization and solely funded by Priscilla and Mark's personal fortune, so understandably there's no stock options for employees.   However, our base salary is 11% higher than the top paying FANG (checked today from levels.fyi) and we also have the most generous 401K matching (10% of gross salary), so that does help close the salary gap  Just make sure to invest a good portion of your salary in the stock market, and you should still be able to retire as a multimillionaire after working a few decades   3. Difficult to quantify impact:  CZI works on really really difficult and extremely long term projects (impacts to be seen in decades), so sometime it could feel that we're not moving the needles and question whether we're actually doing anything to help change the world in the short term.  But it is important to remember that CZI is designed and uniquely positioned to tackle this kind of critical and high impact projects, because we don’t have shareholders to report to nor concerns to make money. So the whole organization is focused on exploring projects where we can make the most impact. And currently that’s Justice & Opportunity, Education, and Science (we’re exploring Environment, but we need to deliver results for the first three initiatives first before taking on more responsibilities)  Another good news is, CZI recently beefed up the Data Science team with the goal to help track and quantify short term and long term CZI impacts, so in the near future we will have more indirect metrics that hold us accountable in the work we do.   Top three reasons to join CZI:  1. Best of both worlds:  Working at an early multi-billion startup means you get the stability and resources of a mega company, but the learning and impact opportunities of a startup.  Many nonprofit organizations suffer from being unable to attract top talents to round out their teams. Luckily, it’s not an issue at CZI. We get world class talents, equipment, community collaboration, and funding to execute on projects  2. Unique impact:  Serving industries where money can’t be made, but are highly critical to the future of our society and communities.  We serve Education, Science, and Justice & Opportunity, because by empowering these backbones of our society, we can build an equal and equitable world where every human gets to realize their full potential, which will also help us prevent, manage, and cure all diseases!  Personally I wish we were living in such a world today, but the next best thing is to be at CZI and actively collaborate with the communities to make this a reality tomorrow  3. Wonderful coworkers, Work/Life Balance, and Perks:   Every day, I feel exhilarated to tackle the unique challenges CZI faces and am grateful to be surrounded by talented coworkers who support and care about each other. Most importantly, I'm constantly inspired by how deeply my coworkers care about the people we serve.   We frequently cry at town hall meetings, learning how social injustice, unequitable education, and diseases are inflicting millions of people in the world. But we also get SUPER fired up knowing that CZI is in a unique position to have a real shot at solving these pressing problems for many generations to come.  As a bonus, CZI is serious about taking care of its employees. We are very family oriented, get generous PTOs, flexible work schedules, work from home Wednesdays, bosses that urge you to take time off, and probably the highest quality catered lunches I’ve seen in the Bay Area tech companies (FANG, Airbnb, LinkedIn, etc.)  So what’s the end game?  We all have limited time to work before we inevitably retire. We all have hopes and dreams we wish to accomplish before it’s too late. We all see where the world is heading to is not where we want it to be.  Since when did we settle for the next big thing to be another phone, another ad sell, or another merchandise purchase, and not another student's aha moment, another equitable opportunity, or another disease cured?  Nobody can tell you what to do with the most valuable currency you have, which is your time. But I hope this post helps you understand what CZI stands for and why we believe in what we do.  After all, the pressing issues call for immediate actions, and 400 of us asked ourselves, ""if not us, who? If not now, when?""  I urge you to stand with us and unite our collective forces to change the world. Only this time, it's for real.",Please see above for the top three reasons not to work at CZI

CZI SWE review,2020-09-01,"Senior Software Engineer in Redwood City, CA",5,,"work life balance is really well, career growth is being considered","the culture here is not mature, overall towards a startup level. senior management is pretty messy and inconsistent"
Joined hopeful but left disappointed,2019-08-20,Anonymous Employee,2,,"- Mission driven organization with very ambitious and admirable goals to make big changes to Education, Science, and reform for critical areas like Criminal Justice, Immigration, and Housing Affordability. - More work/life balance than you'd typically get at other technology orgs, especially startups. It should be noted that this experience did vary depending on the team in which the employee worked. - Company is well funded so teams were not often constrained by resources and/or budgets. This also helped with innovation and experimentation which were usually supported and encouraged.","- Culture plagued with high turnover, layoffs, reorgs, poor employee engagement scores, challenges with inclusion, and constant ambiguity. It's unfortunate that the company's commitment to equity and fairness externally doesn't extend internally to its employee population. The environment created fear among employees when it came to things like voicing an opposing viewpoint, raising management issues, etc. - Communication was cloudy and lacked transparency. It became increasingly difficult to tell facts from ""fake news"" as the perception was that leadership would often ""spin"" information to support their own narrative. - Priscilla Chan was hands-on and incredibly passionate about the work happening externally; however, as the CEO she appeared uninvolved or distant from the business/people, especially given the small size of the company. This was particularly problematic when you had an inexperienced leadership team as it contributed to major cultural and organizational issues. - Company lacked typical checks and balances or accountability for organizational decisions. Although being a well funded startup can be a positive, it can also have negative consequences when decisions/growth strategies are not well thought out at the leadership level. For example, hiring people or departments too early resulting in layoffs, people departures, or general dissatisfaction."

A fast-growing and optimistic organization,2019-10-21,Director,4,,"Working at CZI is a chance to tackle some of the most substantive and substantial problems facing our generation and the ones to come. I found the underlying mission and long-term objectives to be deeply motivating. It is also an organization filled with intelligent and curious colleagues, who were also some of the kindest and most caring I've had the opportunity to work with in my career. The work itself is fast-paced. CZI is a young organization that has a growth mindset, so change is really the only constant. That can be both unsettling, and exciting.","The flip side of the fast pace of change is that the change can be distracting. It is a small and young organization, with all the expectations of a large and established company, given the resources and reputation attached. My main advice for those joining, or considering joining, would be to tune out the change, to the extent possible. The leaders - and specifically Priscilla and Mark - have a long-term mindset, with a strong clarity of vision. It's the path there that is messy and hard to predict. As CZI continues to grow, I think there will be more and more structure and focus, which will be helpful for thinking about priorities within the work, career growth, and work-life balance."
"Technology meet Philanthropy, Philanthropy meet Technology",2019-08-04,"Engineering Manager in Redwood City, CA",4,,"A lot of opportunities to build and look at solving problems in unique ways in comparison to what you'll normally find in Silicon Valley along with really great work/life balance. This largely stems from quick growth while trying to figure out what it means to successfully bring together diverse employees cutting across technology and philanthropy backgrounds. If you're interested in figuring out how to build an organization through these challenges, then you'll find it rewarding and you'll be pushed to grow yourself tremendously.","It's unclear how to successfully weave two very different cultures and backgrounds together which causes organizational challenges on a day to day basis. If you don't enjoy working somewhere which is rapidly evolving, requires nuance to succeed, and forgiveness along the way, then you'll find it quite frustrating."

Too many people with opinions on every little thing but they can't contribute. For such a small org, we move extremely slow. Legal slows down everything we do here. Engineering standards are surprisingly lacking for a company that came out of Facebook - Career ladder: Opportunities not found, politics pervades upper management. They preach equity but if you look at who the directors favor, it's the younger version of themselves.  - Mentorship: This place is great if you're fresh out of college. Otherwise, there are not enough senior/staff engineers to learn from"
Best place I have worked,2019-08-07,"Program Officer in Redwood City, CA",4,,"I have worked at two universities and one philanthropy prior to joining CZI, where I have been for over 2 years. This is, by far, the finest place I have worked. Most importantly, the mission (""a future for everyone"") really does permeate the place. Priscilla Chan is almost always present and a constant reminder of the mission in both her words and, especially, in her actions. The place operates on the highest ethical standards.  It also is interesting in its general aims. There are three philanthropic arms: 1) biomedical science research; 2) K-12 education; 3) advocacy for economic mobility, criminal justice reform, etc. That much is like very many other philanthropies, but there are two unique aspects. First, there are extensive software development teams assigned to each of the three arms. Priscilla and Mark's vision is to have a world class software development team at a philanthropy, a totally unique idea that seems certain to yield unexpected contributions. Second, because CZI is structured as an LLC, they have a 'Ventures' arm that can invest in businesses doing useful work related to CZI's aims, providing backing as needed. Bottom line: CZI has a good heart and a multifaceted, interesting structure.","The Cons are: a) growing pains; b) silos; c) Silicon Valley.  Growing Pains. The number of employees has increased about 10 fold in the 2+ years I've been here and that inevitably causes two kinds of problems: 1) mismatch between headcount and workload; 2) operational errors. On Operations, the growth from a tiny startup to about 500 employees has had many fluctuations (so many different software packages!), but the place keeps adapting and is running so smoothly now. The Operations folks have pulled it off. .... As for workload mismatch, it surely varies in different micro-environments, but I sense that, generally across the organization, there are far more people underworked than overworked. That can be really dissatisfying. Managers should be held to a higher bar before being given more staff. The most overworked group seems to be Recruiting. That's a bad sign.  Silos. The Tech sides are different from the Philanthropy sides, and the three Philanthropy arms have very different specific aims while all focused on increasing opportunity. Many of us hunger to know more about each other's work. Priscilla and Mark do their part with their monthly town halls and Communications does its part with the extensive website, but all that is kind of cheerleading/PR stuff. We seek deeper peer-to-peer communication across CZI sections.  Silicon Valley. It's a great place for the Tech side because of the local concentration of software developers, but can there be a place worse than Silicon Valley for a philanthropy whose central concern is economic mobility? You're just not close to the problem here and this can lead to naivete. Wage stagnation, lack of opportunity, poverty -- an understanding of this is pretty shallow if it comes just from a freshman sociology class. Moreover, many who are fully committed to the mission may feel frustrated by those for whom this is just another stop on a Silicon Valley career path."
"Good mission, but large gaps between perception and reality",2019-10-09,Technical Team,2,,"Funding is not an issue, and the image that CZI creates feels prestigious and altruistic. Priscilla does seem to care about the issues the company addresses.  The 401(k) matching.","FB culture has carried through to parts of CZI, including valuing toxic personalities and a tech elitist attitude. Performance reviews focused on “impact” which is very ambiguous and promotes favoritism and individualism. The middle managers had limited experience. Sharing concerns about management to HR was ineffective.  In a space where employees should have been having lively discussion and sharing different points of view on the work to make it better, few employees were comfortable engaging either due to fear or indifference. The direction was top-down.   Hiring diverse groups of people and then not retaining many of them. This is not the best place for people of color, based on my experience and after speaking with other POC. I have heard that things are improving, but do the homework and ask candid questions about culture, ownership, decision making, and power.  Not sure if the tools that are being developed are being measured or actually help. There’s a bit of a disconnect from the reality and the narrative CZI tells in both the employee culture and the company’s work products. The overall strategy feels top-down and unproven."
A new organization dedicated to making a difference,2019-08-22,Prefer Not To Say,4,,"- Lots of incredibly smart, mission oriented individuals  - Long term focus  - Good benefits  - Unique blend of philanthropy, grant making, investment, technology and advocacy - Working on hard problems - Dedicated (but not yet figured out) how to live diversity well","- This is a well funded, but new organizations. Not all the answers have been sorted out and infrastructure is still getting built. Not good if individuals not comfortable with ambiguity or blank space.  - Lots of people from different backgrounds that speak different ""languages"" per say. Sometimes it takes a bit extra effort to communicate well and sometimes there can be misunderstandings that takes effort to sort out."
Great Ambitions. Focus more on perception than substance. Poor Management.,2019-07-20,"Software Engineer in Redwood City, CA",2,,- Smart people - Flexible schedule - Decent pay and benefits,- Asking employees to speak up but rarely taking actions.  - Touting diversity and inclusion and focusing on recruiting employees but little effort to retain them  - A lot of bureaucracy for this size of organization - Not many projects of substance actually happening. A lot of effort seemed to be spent on perception and not substance. Having trouble retaining product/engineering talent - Lack of respect and fairness. Very top down.
"Noble mission, talented employees, unique challenges",2019-06-04,Product Manager,5,,"- Serving communities with powerful social missions (teachers, scientists, prosecutors) - Priscilla is truly inspiring - Senior management deeply cares about the mission and all the employees - Ability to impact one of the few organizations that can reshape the world  - Exceptionally talented colleagues, both technologists and domain experts - Competitive pay and benefits","The org is one-of-a-kind, wildly ambitious and grew very quickly. There are gaps in process and team cohesion. This is being addressed with senior hires and slowing growth.  Defining success for roles and projects is much harder than in a typical company, which can be daunting."
...,2019-02-14,Anonymous Employee,2,,-Decent pay and benefits for a foundation -Met some amazing people,"As typical of Silicon Valley, especially high turn-over rates, unpleasant work space for POC due to lack of mentorship and other issues.

Toxic Culture and Bad Management,2019-04-24,Anonymous Employee,2,,- Generous pay and benefits  - Some really nice and smart people - Good work/life balance and flexibility for parents,- Very political and hierarchical  - People get promoted because of favoritism not because of skills - The mission sounds promising but company has no real direction - High employee turnover especially in engineering - Hard to advance your career  - Most of management is from Facebook so a lot of things are done the Facebook way
Hot mess,2019-11-13,Anonymous Employee,1,,"Many of the folks at junior/mid level are amazing, smart, and capable folks. They have so much integrity, drive, and vision - so much should be invested in them.","The lack of transparency, clarity, or integrity at leadership level makes it hard to do your job or feel that you are ""safe"" in your job. It seems that many leaders are in their position because they are good friends with the founders, worked at Facebook, or the organization had a hard time finding someone to fill the role so they promoted within. Many of the leaders are not qualified for the departments or orgs that they support. At the senior leadership level, it feels as if it is a constant power struggle where many will manipulate or play games to have ""power"".  There is fear to speak out or ask tough questions, many leaders believe ""If you're not happy, get out"". There is no room to give actionable feedback, some leaders are insecure. Turnover is an issue, some teams were laid off, and there is lack of clarity on the bigger vision. CZI talks about diversity but many leaders feel that they are compromising quality when they hire diverse folks or that they have already reached their quota of diverse folks. It is also concerning when you see strong, diverse leaders leaving the organization.  Engagement surveys are taken but no action or accountability is taken by leadership, many of the conversations that come out is on how to make leadership feel better about results and trainings to employees on how to be sympathetic to leadership."

Best of Both Worlds: Technology and Social Good!,2021-02-17,Initiatives & Operations,5,,"Joined during Shelter in Place and the onboarding experience was amazing.  Growing and evolving start-up that's taking on the biggest social challenges like curing disease and improving education for the betterment of all...
