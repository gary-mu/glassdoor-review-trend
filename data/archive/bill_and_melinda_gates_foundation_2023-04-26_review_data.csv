Great benefits,2023-04-03,"Senior Business Analyst in Seattle, WA",5,,"Fun team environment, great benefits","Sometime ambiguous job duties, need better role clarity"
Great work but poor management,2023-02-05,"Program Officer in Seattle, WA",3,,Lots of smart talented people who are trying to move the needle in the best way they know and can.,"Upper management skews towards private sector backgrounds - management consulting, big pharma and may not have the technical expertise or insights to lead global health or development work."
Great mission,2023-03-14,"Senior Program Officer, Global Health in Seattle, WA",4,,Amazing working on great mission. Extremely fulfilling.,"Demanding job, but not really a con for someone who is driven."
"No heart, no soul",2022-07-01,"Senior Program Officer in Seattle, WA",2,,Access to resources to invest in important areas,"Constant layoffs and turnover due to consultant-driven strategy changes every couple of years. Institution does not care about employees, no effort to grow or retain, sees no value in institutional knowledge or mature relationships with partners and grantees. No logic, no values to layoffs. Behind the times in many areas because listening to consultants with no content expertise rather than technical experts on staff. Despite the rhetoric, extremely risk averse in grant-making. Delegation of authority (everything above 5 M needs approval at the Presidential level) leads to huge bottlenecks and very slow process--approx. 1 year to make a grant... whether it's for 5 million or 30 million--despite the fact that they obsess about strategy, have yearly portfolio reviews, etc."
strong mission but difficult culture,2022-11-17,"Anonymous Employee in Seattle, WA",3,,"Mission, salary, amazing benefits, almost unparalleled opportunity for global impact, network, access to major field leaders","competitive culture, bureaucracy, cookie cutter mold for internal success and advancement, lack of diversity in leadership, not enough time for true innovation and collaboration, pays lip service only to employee reported burnout. Lots of flux right now with governance changes and what it will mean for the organization's future mission and culture."
Program Officer,2023-01-29,"Associate Program Officer in Washington, DC",4,,"Benefits, working with smart people",Confusing org structure and a lot of ambiguity
great pay and benefits; each team has a different culture,2022-01-16,"Senior Program Officer in Seattle, WA",4,,"Pay and benefits are fantastic. These include six months of paid parental leave (although it used to be a full year) and a contribution to one's retirement fund of 15% your salary. In effect, this means that compensation is 15% higher that the salaries you see quoted. Also, if you work and live in Washington state, there's no state income tax. They have some very talented and experienced people at the foundation, and the mission, of course, is a very fulfilling and meaningful one. The foundation also has a very good reputation in most places, so it's a good line on one's resume, and contacting people with a foundation email address helps a lot in getting responses.","Ultimately it's Bill and Melinda who make the decisions. They are very involved in the work of the foundation, and _a lot_ of effort goes into preparing for presenting work to them, and it can be quite a political place. There's also an annual strategy review for most teams, so a lot of energy goes into preparing for that every year. The culture is very different from team to team. Some are amazing and collegial; others are absolutely poisonous, so ask around and have 1:1 conversations with people there before joining a team."

Passionate and smart people; HR is a bit of a mess,2022-09-14,"Senior Officer, Strategy Planning in Seattle, WA",4,,"You will love what you work on, have so much purpose and passion for your work. The people around you are brilliant and super respectful, nice and awesome.",HR is a mess. Policies don't make any sense and they are slow. It's not great. In addition for business minded people career progression is a bit stunted
Great mission,2022-09-22,"Senior Assistant in Seattle, WA",5,,People care about the mission Excellent benefits Competitive pay Lots of resources to lean on Smart people- can make good connections Good leadership (executive leadership team),Lots of internal politics. Some teams are toxic and chaotic like any company. Challenging for admin staff to build their career in an upward trajectory.

Fantastic,2021-10-17,"Senior Program Officer in Seattle, WA",5,,"From the top leadership all the way through to program teams and business partners, the staff are fully committed to the foundation’s mission and values. It is a place to think big and think innovatively about the world’s most pressing challenges, while partnering with the most impactful and exciting local, national and global organizations. The internal environment is highly supportive, with strong, highly conscientious, emphasis on refining culture, values and the working environment. Finally, the benefits are second to none.","While strategy helps structure and articulate grant portfolios , it can constitute a significant - sometimes excessive - part of the work for all program teams, which otherwise could be devoted to grant design, local partnership building or other country-level work. Work life balance can be challenging to achieve based on the role, depending on if the team is sufficiently staffed, but can be developed with the manager."
"Amazing institution, good perks, too many re-orgs",2022-05-29,"Senior Program Officer in Seattle, WA",4,,Great institution doing amazing work. Smart and dedicated staff. Generous benefits.,There is nearly constant re-organizing that means the job you signed up to do may change drastically or disappear. Higher level staff seem blind to the costs of this churn.

Feedback,2022-07-22,"Program Assistant in Seattle, WA",3,,Great benefits Fast-paced Great Connections,No growth opportunities for junior and support staff. Team cultures vary significantly
"Power, Potential, Politics & Hubris",2021-11-27,"Deputy Director in Seattle, WA",3,,"Powerful mission Ability to fund good work that matters, if you are on a team empowered to execute. Good benefits and supports - including during the pandemic. When you have the right leadership and manager you truly feel like you can make a difference in the world. Resources, and the doors they open.",Limited technical expertise or focus on impact in some teams. Constant strategy refresh and overall inward focus impedes long term impact.  Staff seen and treated as disposable = lack of psychological safety on many teams. Little change / impact on diversity and inclusion; no sense of belonging in many teams. Poor track record on immigration support to staff.

"Great benefits and mission, no career tracks",2021-09-09,"Head of Portfolio Management in Seattle, WA",4,,"Benefits are unbelievable Pay is solid, though perhaps a bit less than industry (due to lack of bonuses) People-focused mission Travel opportunities are great - not too much, great locations Brilliant employees Supportive of a work-life balance","No career ladders They only hire experts, and you have to demonstrate experience before you'll get an opportunity to do something (i.e., no stretch opportunities) Most employees are workaholics, and it's hard not to get sucked into that mentality"

Middle Management Rules the Day,2021-03-01,"Senior Program Officer in Seattle, WA",3,,- Great benefits - CEO who seems to genuinely care and wants to work on known cultural problems - Beautiful campus - Connection to a larger mission,"- Your experience is highly manager-dependent and while many are good, some are appallingly bad with little to no consequence. - Performance, credentials, and expertise are valued over interpersonal skills and trust building, allowing some individuals to get away with abusive behavior without consequence. - Total lack of diversity and unconscious adherence to white supremacy culture where cutthroat behavior is normalized and employees who are actually from the places we work are marginalized and/or pushed out and where grant dollars go to white-led institutions, especially in research. - Smart young people are hired and then marginalized with little opportunity for upward mobility. Generally, BMGF is the place to finish your career, not get it started (although there are a few exceptions). Programmatic roles are generally occupied by people who skew toward retirement age.  - Generous benefits for parents on paper, but systemic discrimination of women with caregiving responsibilities in practice. This has showed up in major ways during COVID, where expectation have remained astronomically high and women are starting to leave. I know of several instances of women being denied opportunities or pushed out because of their caregiving responsibilities during COVID. - Major disconnect between our ""talk"" (i.e. what Bill and Melinda write and speak about) and our ""walk"" (i.e. how we do our work and how employees are treated internally)."
experience,2022-01-31,"Auditor in Los Angeles, CA",4,,nice work environment nice people,could get tired when sometimes
Great Environment with limited growth,2021-10-20,"Program Assistant in Seattle, WA",4,,Great environment and great benefits. There is generally a sense of urgency to solve GH problems. You are constantly surrounded by subject matter experts.,Limited growth especially if you are trying to switch from one job family to the other. i.e. Program Assistant to Program Coordinator. Every team is different.
Mission driven org needs to deal with gaslighting and discrimination,2021-07-18,"Researcher in Seattle, WA",1,,"The opportunities to do good for others are immense at the foundation. You can have a huge impact that helps make other peoples' lives better - if you're given the opportunity, but only if. For a person that's mission driven and who fits the bill of who leadership here see as capable of leading work in public health, this a great place to work. On the other hand, if you don't look like who they're comfortable with, best of luck. If you're in public health this place actually pays an appropriate amount for your expertise.","During my time I saw the foundation repeatedly state they cared about diversity, equity, and inclusion, and wanted to move us towards being a more diverse workplace, where all felt included and able to bring their best forward for the mission of the org. And yet, during my tenure I saw multiple women, half women of color, leave my division. Not truly out of choice, but because their management chains were atrocious. Retention is key to making any org a truly inclusive space but I'm quite convinced that several white people here see POC as interchangeable - all you need to do is hire the next POC when one leaves rather than fix the toxic system that views us as less capable and yet asks us for more work than our white colleagues. White men fail upwards here. WOC are pushed out. This needs to stop now and not in 2 or 3 or 5 years from now. But from everything I've seen the foundation's plans to address this, it means taking an incredibly slow pace on this to the detriment of those most discriminated against. Every year our division saw new guidelines about what was required to go up for promotion - and yet none were actually applied equitably. It was disheartening to see that I met most of the requirements for a role twice more senior than what I had and to hear from multiple colleagues that they saw that in me as well, but to get the opposite message from my chain of management who were disengaged with my work. There's very little accountability here when you're discriminated against. Many people hired here are bright, smart individuals but know nothing about what they're hired to do. People hired to do public health research and yet have never done it before and are managed by other researchers with no prior experience in the field either. It's the (hopeful) blind leading the blind here and the people purportedly being served and supported by this research deserve better. But you won't get that when you have poor leadership with little relevant experience with the field (here I'm not referring to the CEO, but rather individuals lower than that). Finally, let me repeat: I was gaslit by several people in my division. Bringing it forward did nothing for me besides put a target on my back. White men have questioned my work when they have no expertise in it and they are taken seriously solely because of the seniority of their role but not their actual experience. They can speak to you condescendingly and nothing will happen to them even if you bring it forward. They can repeatedly fail at doing their jobs and be given chance after chance, more training, more time, etc but POC will not be given the same support. I could not recommend this place for any POC at the moment as it's unsafe to be our authentic selves."
"Good work life balance, excellent benefits and coworkers",2021-11-17,"Program Assistant in Seattle, WA",5,,"work life balance, organized and talented co-workers, team oriented, top notch benefits",not many opportunities for growth
"Great people, Great work",2021-02-01,"Software Test Engineer in Seattle, WA",5,,"The people at this company are some of the smartest and most dedicated I've ever met. Everyone truly believes in the value of what they are doing and this sense of duty is present in daily work and interactions. Benefits are amazing, pay is good, and ability to go to sleep at night has gone up remarkably with the start of this job.","People work a lot. People work so hard and so often that the company has ""quiet weeks"" which ensure that people can't do meetings and are forced to focus on work and take it easy. Management definitely tries to get people to work less but if your work is ""saving the world"" it becomes harder and harder to justify taking time off. That said, much effort is made to ensure that employees have a good work life balance."

As a private foundation, they can take controversial stances and innovate in ways you often don't see elsewhere in development. I feel lucky to contribute.  Employees are treated very well. The benefits are amazing","There are the usual office politics, and a lot of credit-seeking driven by individual egos, but I think that is pretty normal in an organization, especially one trying to attract 'the best'.   Employees are treated very well, sometimes too well (e.g. business class flights), which is uncomfortable when thinking about the geographies we serve and how that money could be better spent."

"It isn't perfect, but what place is?",2011-03-10,"Operations - Program Assistant in Seattle, WA",4,,"Generous benefits (insurance, matching for retirement, up to date technology items, free snacks/sodas, etc.), generally an overall positive team environment, individuals who are focused not only on their own professional improvements, but also overall team improvements.  As the foundation grows in size, there are gradual improvements to process which yes take time to implement, but are done so with careful consideration (albeit sometimes over democratic rationale) of input.  I am a 4+ year veteran of the foundation and I still love coming to work 95% of the time.","At times can be difficult to communicate effectively with other teams. What I don't understand are some of the budgeting decisions made as this organization operates under the idea that there is a limitation to funds yet the co-chairs spend literally crazy amounts of funds to build a new campus.  There are still general feelings of unfairness between programs and operations units - the program areas definitely get preferential treatment. Programs and operations are held to differing standards of ROI, expenditures, employee performance and behaviors. More could be done from the foundation's leadership team to finally once and for all truly try to change perspectives and behaviors between the programs and operations.  There are still pockets of individuals who choose to push their hierarchy/title upon others."

"Great place to work, but not a place where everyone will thrive",2018-06-06,"Program Officer in Seattle, WA",4,,"1. Opportunity to play a part in addressing some of the biggest, most important challenges of our time 2. You'll get professional opportunities here you won't get anywhere else (e.g. who you get to work with, events you get to participate in, speakers that come to the foundation) 3. Unparalleled benefits 4. Beautiful workspace 5. Very flexible working schedule","You're experience will vary widely team-by-team, but basically:  1. The foundation has yet to create a culture and work environment where people of different backgrounds can thrive. Right now, it favors workaholic types with American communication styles (e.g. speaking in bullets, very direct) 2. Pretty much constant change--the decision-making process for which is not always transparent or fair. 3. While the CEO and executive leadership team are trying to address this, managers are generally pretty weak. Don't expect a lot of time or support in terms of mentorship or support to grow your career. 4. Because there are few open positions, it can be hard to ""move up""--especially from PO to SPO and SPO to DD."
Overhiring is a Major Issue....,2016-03-09,"Anonymous Employee in Seattle, WA",3,,"This is a wonderful organization that does incredible work, and feeling like you're contributing to the mission is incredibly motivating and inspiring. The CEO is a brilliant woman and seems to generally care about the happiness and well-being of the staff. The work done by the program teams, in spite of themselves, is valuable and important work. We are making a difference.","OMG -- seriously, stop with the over-hiring! Just because you CAN hire a double- or triple PhD from Harvard doesn't mean you SHOULD. Overall the organization is STILL too large, too reliant on contractors and consultants (don't get me started on IT) and the scope of your work will be incredibly small, so you will fee like you just magically stepped ten years back in your career. Nowhere to develop, grow, or advance. Stagnation."
Nothing good comes easy.,2019-12-15,"Senior Program Coordinator in Seattle, WA",4,,"At BMGF I worked with some of the most remarkable colleagues - not just intelligent and accomplished, but truly kind and caring folks with unique backgrounds and life experiences to contribute. Benefits are outstanding. Wonderful, consistent learning opportunities and depending on your team, chances to stretch and gain new skills with exciting projects.","Nothing dominates an organizational culture more than how it defines success. At BMGF, success is working as diligently as possible, as often as possible, and being the smartest person in the room (or at least in your subject area). Its borderline obsessed with how ""complicated"" and ""difficult"" its work is, and it sometimes seems like you earn more points for taking apart a problem analytically, than actually figuring out how to have tangible impact The result is a very curious, learning-oriented, but ultimately inward-facing organization that's more afraid to fail than its willing to admit. If you're already working in development, this won't be news to you. But any person should know what you're getting into, and how you want to navigate it - work/life balance will be 100% up to you."
Programmatic role,2015-07-01,"in Seattle, WA",3,,"Strong benefits (12 weeks maternity/paternity leave + ability to add vacation, low co-pay, wide coverage); compensation is average and uneven but decent enough; nice campus; many learning opportunities and ability to be creative and risk-taking about solving big problems; great colleagues; options to work remotely with flexible hours","Meeting heavy; poor management (indecisive, churning around ideas without concrete actions; bullying behavior goes unaddressed); little investment in staff and little career growth with some teams having an outright ""no promotions"" policy; little value for institutional knowledge but without strong IT-related knowledge management systems so a lot of information walks out the door when staff/consultants leave; constant focus on strategy refreshes/reviews which pull staff from primary work; unsupportive HR (or rather HR is clearly there to protect the company rather than the staff); at the moment, there has been a crack-down on hiring consultants--that combined with a lean staffing model and too few junior staff, burn out is high and quality is going down as employees are stretched beyond capacity and can't devote enought time to any one thing; highly stressful environment; great values on paper but they don't translate toward staff"
Hard work for a history-making institution,2015-08-30,"Senior Manager in Seattle, WA",3,,"The aim of the foundation is to deliver on the belief that everyone deserves the chance to live a healthy and productive life; as an employee, all of your work goes towards this, even if it may not feel like it every day. I'm so proud of the organization, my time there, and the effort of so many creative passionate coworkers, not to mention the impact on millions of lives, now and forever. You're part of something bigger than yourself and that's tough to beat.","The foundation has gotten much larger over the years. Its giving has also increased substantially, both in terms of amount and geographical distribution. As such, I think it has become more complicated to get things done inside of the foundation. The organizational processes haven't quite kept pace and I think people don't necessarily stop to improve, but instead work harder to get things done. I don't think this is very different from any other growing organization. Leaders, along with staff, are actively focused on improving this."

"Inspiring mission, too bogged down in internal politics",2016-05-07,"Program Officer in Seattle, WA",3,,"The pay and benefits are amazing, and the mission is inspiring. In my experience I've been able to professionally develop and advance within the organization, although I agree with other reviews that these opportunities can be highly dependent on supportive teams and managers. Representing the foundation you get to be a part of many high-level conversations at the global level and benefit from working with partners who are at the forefront of the field in both research and implementation.","The work environment is very politically charged and it is easy to get bogged down in internal churn. I don't know if it is typical for this size of an organization, but the number of reorgs seems unnecessary and a huge barrier for getting work done. It's also tough for morale when smart and effective people are getting laid off and people who are good at upward politics but seem to care less about the actual work are recognized and promoted."

The framework (of how teams report upwards) and executive leadership continues to operate in a clunky old-boys club fashion. Considering how dismal morale is across the entire company, I and many others believe that change is currently underway; however, the change is being done in such a mean, rapid, and secretive state that many current employees such as myself are meant to feel like pawns.  The family feeling that once existed as vanished and there is no hope of it coming back. Bill and Melinda have not been present."

There is a competitive feeling throughout the company that can feel oppressive, but they still embrance a sense of creativity and change.

I wish every job was like this,2015-10-05,"in Seattle, WA",5,,Excellent pay and benefits Lot of fun activities within departments You get to work with very smart and creative people that are dedicated to their work and making the world a better place,"None except that It's hard to get a job here.

Useful observations for people considering a job at the foundation,2013-01-21,"Financial Manager in Seattle, WA",4,,"• It is a fast-paced and constantly evolving place. If you don’t enjoy being an active part of a changing environment or dealing with uncertainty, this can be a stressful place. If you thrive in dynamic environments, you will find lots of opportunity to shape how the organization does business.  • The foundation is in a lucky situation to attract highly capable people. If you used to be the top performer on your team in your prior job, don’t be surprised if you’re suddenly surrounded by people who are equally smart, dedicated and high performing. It is up to you whether you choose to check your ego at the door and get excited about working with such a peer group or whether you get intimidated and feel like others are out-shining you. Contrary to some other comments, I haven’t seen much backstabbing going on, but I can imagine that some people used to feel more exceptional before joining the foundation and end up interpreting their new environment as less friendly than it really is.  • The diversity of people’s careers is impressive – many have deep scientific backgrounds, others are business people or have worked in policy-related jobs. The workforce is very international, though it would be good to continue to grow the share of people coming from developing countries. Having the openness and flexibility to work effectively with a broad spectrum of people is crucial for someone to enjoy working at the foundation.  • There is a substantial amount of bureaucracy involved in the foundation’s work, and given the incredible number and size of investments that are being made every year, this is no surprise (for comparison, think about a corporate procurement department that processes $3-4bn in contracts every year, many of which go to overseas organizations and involve complex issues such as IP, clinical trials, etc.). The foundation’s business processes are maturing continuously and I’ve seen considerable progress since I joined. To be frank, working here is not all about inventing new ways to save kids in Africa, it is also about doing the necessary due diligence and paperwork that goes into making responsible long-term investments.  • I got a sense that manager effectiveness and career development were not prioritized in the foundation’s early years. In the last couple of years, however, we’ve seen strong awareness of these topics among senior management, accompanied by very concrete steps taken to address them. The foundation is moving gradually toward a mature business that figures out how to manage its talent more effectively. I’ve been very satisfied with my superiors since I joined, but can understand that others were perhaps less lucky and found themselves working for a boss whose strengths were in vaccine science and not people management.  • Benefits are excellent. Pay is very good for a non-profit, though it may be higher in the private sector for certain job profiles. However, if these are important factors in your decision to work for the foundation, you should probably ask yourself if you really belong here.","See under PROs Many aspects of working at the foundation have a positive and a negative side. I attempted to explain in a balanced way and posted them above.  Personally, I am very satisfied with my job at the foundation and would say that the pros clearly outweigh the cons."

Working for the BMGF is very interesting and can be rewarding, but you need to celebrate internally because no one ever says 'thank you' or 'good job'.","Terrible work environment and culture. The pace and the demands of the job eventually wear you down mentally and physically and many employees end up needing mental health care. Everyone who works on a scientific or technical team is eventually forced out of the organization by their manager or management, usually in a horrible undignified way. Employees are used by the organization until they are burned out and then they are cast adrift. The co-chairs when asked will admit that they aren't looking for long term employees.

The place can sometimes feel like something out of Kafka or Heller.  -It's also true that it can be a very cut-throat place, but that varied by team, manager, and director.  -And it's also true about the perpetually shifting sands, continual reorgs, and endless Powerpoints. I think one reason for this is the unrealistic goal-setting, at least in some program areas. Departments often set themselves up for failure by setting goals that are nearly impossible and whose achievement they have no control over.  -Permanent sense of inadequacy: Despite year after year of positive reviews and 360s there was always a nagging sense of inadequacy. (As one colleague, a Stanford PhD, once put it, ""I've never worked anywhere where I felt so dumb."") I felt bad about myself all the time, even when I was winning awards for service. -There is a lot of churn, and very little chance for advancement. But it should be noted that the organization is very up-front about this. They make it clear: No career ladder. And while there are no formal ""term limits"" for program staff, there's an expectation that you'll cycle back into your field after 3-5 years. -All the policies and tools that enable you to work anytime, anywhere--which is great for flexibility--can, along with all the pressure, make work-life balance difficult. (But some managers and directors do try to mitigate the problem, with some success.)"

Horrible culture and lousy hiring,2017-04-25,"Anonymous Employee in Seattle, WA",2,,Great benefits and competitive salary.,"This is not a company that lives by a set of principles. If you ask any employee, what are the principles you think that operate here - most likely answer will be ""selfishness"" - which is counterintuitive when you look at the mission. Arrogant self-promoters and middle management with no values is the norm here. There is a belief in ""rock star"" syndrome which deters collaboration and stifles ""growth mindset."" The place is inundated with political hawks who are there to score points at the expense of the mission. Humility is not appreciated nor rewarded."
It really depends on your team,2016-03-27,"Associate Program Officer in Seattle, WA",3,,"-These are the smartest people I've ever worked with.

The work is always challenging. -Great benefits.","-The mandate is always expanding, but human resources are closely capped. Always asked to do more with less. -Happiness here really depends on your team. A few teams are really well-managed, and those folks are very happy. But that's the minority. -Really top-heavy structure that focuses on bringing in top talent at the top but does not work to grow their people from within.  -Many technical experts put into management positions that are not in their skill set.  -Tendency to gloss over the root causes of staff dissatisfaction by having more ""team-building"" and parties, but not fixing fundamental flaws. -Program assistant and contract staff are often treated wretchedly. We hire all these bright, enthusiastic kids in their early 20s with MAs already who think being a PA is a foot in the door here, but it isn't, and then they are so unhappy in assistant roles."
There are much better places to dedicate your time and talents to!,2018-02-01,"Senior Program Officer in Seattle, WA",2,,"Flexibility, good work/life balance (besides the travel, but that comes with the industry), generous benefits, and the chance to work with some fantastic grantees and partners.","Disfunction comes from the very top, and creates a lot of fear, toxicity, inefficiencies, and wasted resources. Although large in staff size and endowment, Gates is a family foundation with active benefactors and has never (successfully) reckoned with the fact that family values, perspectives, and ways of engaging with staff might be fundamentally at odds with the ""data-driven, impact-oriented, feminist (ha!)"" institution that BMGF spins itself as. The generosity of the Gates Family is (obviously) worthy of celebration and respect, but they often treat their staff with disrespect and create a culture where fear of being wrong (or, gasp, just acknowledging we don't have all the answers) gets in the way of any genuine learning, sharing, and progress.   There is also a culture of constant complaining and negativity that gets old immediately. The lack of humility (and, to be frank, connection to reality) is truly astounding; it's an institution and culture that celebrates and seems to incentivize grandstanding amongst all levels of staff.   I had a decent boss, autonomy with my work, and loved making grants, but the culture and leadership was uninspiring on the best days and painful the rest of the time. I've worked at a variety of academic, public, and private institutions over the past several decades and have never had a workplace where people crying (yes, crying) was a regular occurrence. Leaving felt incredibly freeing, and I have been much, much happier at another global health institution."
"Strong mission, hard culture",2017-10-13,"Program Officer in Seattle, WA",2,,"Smart colleagues, mission, pay, benefits, physical space, impact on the world. Some marginal improvements in the culture. CEO ethical and has good ideas. Bill and Melinda are inspiring and the work is really important.","I’ve been at the foundation for 10 years and the lack of collaboration at exec level remains a challenge. Lot of good talk about culture but everyone knows that senior execs throw each other under the bus and go to Bill to get funding. Loss of top operations leaders (COO earlier, CFO leaving soon), who modeled the right collaborative behavior and culture attributes, has been disheartening. Commute to/from east side getting worse and worse."
Great mission; poor culture,2017-01-19,"Senior Program Officer in Seattle, WA",2,,"Work on large-scale, transformative solutions to gnarly global challenges. There is no other place that does this kind of work at this scale. People are very smart (& they know it!).","The culture is very bad and management is very slow to implement change. A recent employee survey quoted the culture as one of ""sharks and vultures."" There is also an unspoken hubris centered around the 'white savior' complex that manifests itself in the outsized influence we have in the global development space. This is due, in part, to the lack of diversity in hiring both ethnically and academically. It is not a humble organization and it does not hire a lot of humble people b/c the outspoken, self-promoters are rewarded and thus, that behavior is reinforced. I have seen my colleagues plagiarize the work of our grantees, take credit for work they did not do (through benign 'lack of acknowledgement'), relentlessly self-promote, and hide failures in order to protect their reputations - all so, they can be visible. Additionally, there are few opportunities to get promoted despite the plethora of jobs. In one instance, I heard a manager say that ""we hire for a job; not a career.""  Even many long term staff admit that the only reason they stay is b/c of the ""golden handcuffs."" The salary and benefits are so generous that it makes it hard to leave, especially in Seattle where there are few other options where you can go to do mission-oriented work and still make a corporate salary."
The awesome benefits in no way justify the lack of leadership and general decency for many are treated.,2012-03-31,"in Seattle, WA",2,,The benefits package is great and comprehensive. New campus is beautiful and gives an appearance of transparency. Location near Space Needle is a bonus.,"No understanding of the difference between leadership and managing/supervising. Non liberal/democrats will be shunned -- in the most passive/agressive manner possible, as this is predominant personality trait at foundation. High-school cliques, bad-behavior, gossip and mis-information determine one's perceived value, as senior-most managers take and any bits of information to churn out what they later call ""performance reveiws"".

Arrogant self-promoters and middle management with no values is the norm here. There is a belief in ""rock star"" syndrome which deters collaboration and stifles ""growth mindset."" The place is inundated with political hawks who are there to score points at the expense of the mission. Humility is not appreciated nor rewarded."

It really depends on your team,2016-03-27,"Associate Program Officer in Seattle, WA",3,,"-These are the smartest people I've ever worked with.

Always asked to do more with less. -Happiness here really depends on your team. A few teams are really well-managed, and those folks are very happy. But that's the minority. -Really top-heavy structure that focuses on bringing in top talent at the top but does not work to grow their people from within.  -Many technical experts put into management positions that are not in their skill set.  -Tendency to gloss over the root causes of staff dissatisfaction by having more ""team-building"" and parties, but not fixing fundamental flaws. -Program assistant and contract staff are often treated wretchedly. We hire all these bright, enthusiastic kids in their early 20s with MAs already who think being a PA is a foot in the door here, but it isn't, and then they are so unhappy in assistant roles."
There are much better places to dedicate your time and talents to!,2018-02-01,"Senior Program Officer in Seattle, WA",2,,"Flexibility, good work/life balance (besides the travel, but that comes with the industry), generous benefits, and the chance to work with some fantastic grantees and partners.","Disfunction comes from the very top, and creates a lot of fear, toxicity, inefficiencies, and wasted resources. Although large in staff size and endowment, Gates is a family foundation with active benefactors and has never (successfully) reckoned with the fact that family values, perspectives, and ways of engaging with staff might be fundamentally at odds with the ""data-driven, impact-oriented, feminist (ha!)"" institution that BMGF spins itself as. The generosity of the Gates Family is (obviously) worthy of celebration and respect, but they often treat their staff with disrespect and create a culture where fear of being wrong (or, gasp, just acknowledging we don't have all the answers) gets in the way of any genuine learning, sharing, and progress.   There is also a culture of constant complaining and negativity that gets old immediately. The lack of humility (and, to be frank, connection to reality) is truly astounding; it's an institution and culture that celebrates and seems to incentivize grandstanding amongst all levels of staff.   I had a decent boss, autonomy with my work, and loved making grants, but the culture and leadership was uninspiring on the best days and painful the rest of the time. I've worked at a variety of academic, public, and private institutions over the past several decades and have never had a workplace where people crying (yes, crying) was a regular occurrence. Leaving felt incredibly freeing, and I have been much, much happier at another global health institution."

There is no other place that does this kind of work at this scale. People are very smart (& they know it!).","The culture is very bad and management is very slow to implement change. A recent employee survey quoted the culture as one of ""sharks and vultures."" There is also an unspoken hubris centered around the 'white savior' complex that manifests itself in the outsized influence we have in the global development space. This is due, in part, to the lack of diversity in hiring both ethnically and academically. It is not a humble organization and it does not hire a lot of humble people b/c the outspoken, self-promoters are rewarded and thus, that behavior is reinforced. I have seen my colleagues plagiarize the work of our grantees, take credit for work they did not do (through benign 'lack of acknowledgement'), relentlessly self-promote, and hide failures in order to protect their reputations - all so, they can be visible. Additionally, there are few opportunities to get promoted despite the plethora of jobs. In one instance, I heard a manager say that ""we hire for a job; not a career.""  Even many long term staff admit that the only reason they stay is b/c of the ""golden handcuffs."" The salary and benefits are so generous that it makes it hard to leave, especially in Seattle where there are few other options where you can go to do mission-oriented work and still make a corporate salary."
The awesome benefits in no way justify the lack of leadership and general decency for many are treated.,2012-03-31,"in Seattle, WA",2,,The benefits package is great and comprehensive. New campus is beautiful and gives an appearance of transparency. Location near Space Needle is a bonus.,"No understanding of the difference between leadership and managing/supervising. Non liberal/democrats will be shunned -- in the most passive/agressive manner possible, as this is predominant personality trait at foundation.

HR exists to protect upper management, period. No ability for this entity to assess, resolve, mentor, guide or direct employees that don't see eye to eye to resolution."
Stressful Environment,2015-11-19,"Program Assistant in Seattle, WA",3,,Benefits are amazing and you are exposed to ground breaking and important ideas and leaders. The people that work there are very mindful and caring in their pursuit to solve some of the world's biggest problems.,Very stressful environment. They suck the life out of you. There is no work-life balance even though they try to convince you there is. The upper management is not in touch with what the real work involves. They take imprudent shortcuts to look like they are saving money. There is a definite imbalance between the intellectual/academic knowledge and good business practices. They hire for a very specific bit of expertise and then there is verylittle mobility within the organization -- especially at the lower levels.
Still maturing as an organization - Positive experiences far outweigh the growing pains,2011-05-19,"Information Technology Professional in Seattle, WA",4,,"- The mission of the foundation helps you get through the tough times, and lifts you up through the good times - Without question, You work with the best and the brightest in any respective field, at all levels of the organization. - The foundation's clients (grantees) are some of the best and brightest as well, and are highly passionate about the work that they do - Operates more like a corporation than a grass-roots 501c3 (can be good and bad) - Good information sharing from executive management. More face-to-face time with execs than your typical medium sized organization. - Excellent suite of benefits - Excellent physical work space with a strong emphasis on the employee, alternative working styles, etc  Counterpoints: - An appropriate amount of growth/management opportunities availible to those up to the task. One can't complain about having inexperienced managers as well as having no growth opportunities. The inexperienced managers are in place because they were given the opportunity to manage. - The foundation is highly diverse, particuarly within Global Development, Global Health, and IT. You will work with individuals from all over the word, with rich experiences from a multitude of organizations and cultures.",- Consensus driven conservative decision making. As a result it is difficult and generally more difficult costly to acomplish tasks and projects compared to other non-profit/for-profit organizations - High number of IT consultants/contractors can make knowledge retention and consistent strategies/methodologies a challenge (noticiable full-time hiring ramp up within the last 6 months though) - Operates more like a corporation than a grass-roots 501c3 (can be good and bad) - Limited process consistency across the various grant-distributing facets of the organization that should run in a similar manner. This makes IT solutioning difficult.
Rode hard and...yeah...,2016-05-15,"Project Coordinator in Seattle, WA",1,,"The mIddle- and low-level employees that actually get the day-to-day work done are amazing individuals. Some of the smartest, most compassionate people I've ever met. Great benefits package (5 stars). Salaries are good for those coming from the non-profit world, but no where near where they need to be for the level of work that's being done (1 star).","Leadership is not interested in employee development whatsoever. They say that each person has a budget allowance for it each year, but in 8 years, none of my requests were ever approved. Management is more interested in paying BIG BIG bucks to McKinsey and the like instead of developing their own talent. Good employees are used and abused and then unceremoniously let go when their positions have been ""phased out"" due to yet another reorganization."
Program Officer,2015-07-06,"Program Officer in Seattle, WA",2,,"There is no shortage of opportunities at the foundation. If you are proactive and don't get burned out (and have a decent manager) you can certainly create opportunities to grow and learn while you are there. But you will most certainly need to create them for yourself. If you come into the right role, you will have the world at your fingertips.   What is said about the benefits and compensation is true as well. It's really a first class package and above any industry standard for many of the positions here.","As an individual who had previously only worked at small organizations, this was an eye-opening experience for me. I can only imagine that it must be akin to working in a massive bureaucracy or government agency.   Everyone is on a different page here and things are constantly evolving at a rate that seems nearly impossible and certainly irresponsible. Restructurings of teams and strategy refreshes come rolling down the hill before teams are even able to get their feet under them. It's all quite MSFT-y in the culture and driven by a very, very old-fashioned, centralized, top-down management structure. Achieving any sort of actual results towards the mission within this environment is not impossible, but it certainly is the exception.   Managers are not incentivized to manage, lead, or make decisions. They are all accountable as individual contributors, so at the end of the day they are looking out for themselves. Nearly everyone who walks through the door (and I will certainly admit I am not immune to this) is on the personal quest for their own significance as it relates to the mission. This can very often override the greater good and any sense of working as a team.   The most important thing to know in all of this is that every dysfunction leads back to the founders themselves. Much of the problems are not solvable because of this fact. No one is able to have frank conversations with them. They dictate the culture at the very top and this drives everything else below. An annual results review meeting with each team is like presenting in front of a royal court. The weeks and months of churn and anxiety that lead up to these meetings are astounding and this is just one example.    Bottom line: go there for the opportunities, go there for your own career, but don't go there expecting to actually contribute to social impact."

"Mission is good, the leadership is bad",2016-09-11,"in Seattle, WA",1,,Benefits are top notch. Salary is somewhat comparable. The backbone and passion lies in the people and the grant makers.,"The challenge is that operations departments like HR and IT are run by egocentric people. If you look at these leaders, they are more interested in gettign an article in a magazine, working on fluff projects, and speaking to industry people, than actually running their operational teams. It is amazing how much money gets spent internally on remodeling for a ""better IT"" experience, instead of funding grants. In the programs you have the presidents doing pretty much whatever they want, so there is no congruity in the process and how money gets spent in this organization."
Excellent Company,2017-08-10,"Program Assistant in Seattle, WA",5,,"The mission, the BENEFITS, the travel, and the people - it is an amazing place to work.",Most people in administrative roles are over qualified for their job. There isn't a clear career path at the organization.
"Great benefits, smart people, limited by reorgs",2020-02-13,"Legal Assistant in Seattle, WA",4,,"Benefits, beautiful office environment, Seattle location closes for week in December, onsite gym","Constant reorgs, no room for growth, lots of bureaucracy and politics, meeting culture and all decisions made by committee, which slows progress and waters down ideas"

Program Assistant Role in Global Development,2016-08-06,"Program Assistant in Seattle, WA",3,,"Amazing network, great benefits, work from home Fridays, knowledge acquisition. There are always speakers and big events going on at Gates. Attending these events was like getting a masters in topic specific public health without paying tuition. There is a lot of opportunity to learn at Gates.",The culture can be quite cut throat and the tension around the office can get intense. There a many systems in place that do not work effectively and hinder performance.
Same challenging place to work as it has always been,2011-06-08,"in Seattle, WA",1,,Benefits are outstanding The mission is truly worth while Compensation is fair market or above,The IT department lacks both leadership and accountability for delivering anything. Leadership sets ambiguous directions or goals and then are overlycritical about the progress or results and blame the team. Senior Management is not interested in the sucess or growth of their employees. The majority of senior management have consultants full time or part time to actually run the teams.
I loved my work but did not like the organizational culture.,2010-07-13,"Program Officer in Seattle, WA",2,,The mission  The amazing grantees you get to interact with  Brilliant and committed colleagues Great benefits  Nice offices and location The opportunity to constantly grow brain cells Resources People outside of the organization are impressed and interested in your work,"When you are inside you begin to realize that the emperor has no clothes. It is a fast-paced, mean, competitive culture where people with no life outside of work excel. I began to feel like I was on survivor. I was great at my job, but the process, bureaucracy, hierarchy, constant spin and changing of directions was disheartening and made my work difficult. The worst part was watching the effect on my grantees and the field. The leadership and management are horrible. Yelling, fist pounding and insults from management and leadership are tolerated. HR is not to be trusted. The slogan is ""every life has equal value"" but that must only be true outside of the doors because inside there are definitely lives that are valued above others based on pedigree and position."
Solid mission- but hostile work environment,2011-01-24,"in Seattle, WA",1,,"-The overall mission of the Foundation -Generous benefits package (health, dental, vision, and contribution to a 401k plan)",-The Foundation is an unusual organization. It is plagued by management and leadership issues.  -The entire culture is defined by the hostile and chaotic work environment.  -Very 'America-centric' place to work. It isn't necessarily tolerant of people from different cultural backgrounds.  -Old boy's club- that likes to promote based on nepotism. -Disrespect of non-Christian religious backgrounds. HR does nothing to address or help people who feel attacked and disrespected. -Arrogance- as the grantees have also complained. -President of Global Development often has personality conflicts- which affect the entire silo. -Hostile work environment with arbitrary decision-making and yelling.
Gates Foundation,2015-06-22,"Anonymous Employee in Seattle, WA",4,,"Mission of the foundation is easy to get behind - all lives have equal value. Work with good people.

Stressful job and mean people,2011-06-16,"in Seattle, WA",2,,Great new campus and bike lockers,1st year you will spend 70 hours per week working. The 2nd not much less. Support of management for consultants is more than the full time employees. Management support a mean culture that take people down. In most cases it is the full time employees that suffers the most. Not a good environment for the long term. If you have family don't work here.

Feel good about where you work,2013-05-15,"Anonymous Employee in Seattle, WA",4,,"Satisfying to work at a place where even if you're not doing the work on the ground, the work you do enables it in some way.",There is a fine line between pride of enabling good work and arrogance. There seems to be quite a bit of the latter and that was disappointing.
Great mission held back by the culture.,2013-07-16,"Manager in Seattle, WA",2,,"Great mission, and the Gates family is hugely inspirational. Great place to work with a diverse group of people and learn a lot, and be exposed to experiences that can't be found elsewhere. Benefits are great, probably some of the best around.","For a non-profit It's an extremely competitive work environment. The culture encourages narcissism and entitlement, an there's an abundance of nepotism in hiring. Most managers don't know how to manage employees or budgets."
Not for everyone,2016-03-04,"Senior Program Assistant in Seattle, WA",4,,You have the opportunity to be a part of doing something positive in the world and to meet some terrific people.,"It can feel like working for a behemoth and decision-making is confusing and often senseless, even on small teams."

"Noble mission and goals, but substandard management/execution",2016-08-27,"Program Officer in Seattle, WA",1,,Great mission and visionary goals. The large endowment and payout make the Gates Foundation a true game changer in the development business. Advocacy by the Co-Chairs has tremendous potential.,Lots of shifting strategies. Lack of clear priorities and institutional policies - change in leadership/director roles brings change in entire teams. HR is not well developed. Country offices are a drag.
So much potential...,2013-01-16,"Anonymous Employee in South Seattle, WA",2,,Smart people; significant funding to do interesting work; great mission; committed co-chairs,"People are not very nice; a place where favoritism reigns, resulting in a lot of sucking up to superiors; not diverse, despite the populations and geographies we intend to reach (related: program officers have very little, if any, experience living and working in those geographies); highly theoretical, not very practical;"
Too many layers and constant process change,2018-03-27,"Program Officer in Seattle, WA",3,,Excellent pay and benefits. Flexibility in developing and managing grants.,"Too many layers of ""managers"" and ""consultants"" with minimal development experience between program officers and the co chairs. More talk about ""rigor"" and ""intellectual dialogue"" than actually existed."
Constant Change,2013-07-18,"Anonymous Employee in Seattle, WA",2,,Great new campus environment; some good people in the ranks,"Lack of vision and leadership leads to constantly reorganizing the business units and programs. Too much middle management and lots of folks with big ol' egos. Raikes' temper tantrums were mildly entertaining at least.   There's no work/life balance at this organization- everyone wants to prove they are the hard-charging, A-student, workforce superhero. All of this and what is really being accomplished?"

Excellent Benefits,2019-06-11,"Program Coordinator in Seattle, WA",4,,Benefits and mission are excellent,Culture is toxic and impractical - well intended but exhausting
no promotions on some teams,2015-05-31,"Associate Program Officer in Seattle, WA",2,,"career advancement, and pay is generous when compared externally",pay and responsibilities for the APO job range exorbitantly.

Toxic culture and managers prevent contributing consistently towards worthwhile foundation mission,2014-02-16,"Anonymous Employee in Seattle, WA",1,,Adding BMGF name to your resume Beautiful campus Competitive pay and benefits,"Subject matter experts with no previous people-managing experience consistently given supervisory roles over teams. This lack of leadership experience (and yes folks, leading is different than managing) coupled with the elitist, politically deceitful and purposeful back-stabbing of colleagues, team-members and consultants results in a perfect-storm of toxicity and dehumanizing behavior. Shamefully, you'll find this behavior not only tolerated, but rewarded and enabled at the cost of rapid mass exodus from toxic teams. Is upper management really unable to discern that the problem is the so-called leader placed over these teams?  Witnessing borderline abusive and demoralizing approaches with employees, contingent workers(who truly are treated as sub-human at times) and consultants with no accountability, for years now, is stomach-churning, at best.   HR team is liken to the foundation's personal mafia. Do NOT engage this department unless you are prepared to be targeted next. Sadly, our team has watched multiple highly skilled, accomplished, capable team members fall wayside to their procedure ""siding with upper management to create 'performance issues' for employees who seek their guidance or bring legitimate grievances to their attention"". Not safe! The revolving doors in teams across the foundation are testament to this.  The amazing work-life balance others report is solely dependent upon the team you land in and the manager you have. For many, expect to work 60+ hours, with direction to report anything over 40 hours as overtime, then prepare to defend your ""level of efficiency"" as a thank-you for your hard work.   If you are seeking employment here, be sure to conduct your due-diligence about the specific reputation, practices, and managing principles of your potential team. This may make or break your entire experience."
