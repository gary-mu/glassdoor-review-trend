Great Place to Work,2023-02-28,"Seasonal Brand Ambassador in New York, NY",5,,Super friendly managers and fellow coworkers Snacks are always available!!,I don’t have any cons
Company isn't what it used to be,2023-04-14,"Keyholder/Floor Leader in New York, NY",1,,Free snacks you meet great people there free shoes and clothes,Worked here prior to the pandemic and during the pandemic and wow this place has gone done the drain. They had such amazing leaders to begin with but once they brought in a whole new team to change the direction of the company everything went to crap. They opened up way too many stores that now some stores are understaffed and you have to do so much more work when the pay is not worth it. Incompetent managers have been brought in and pretty much don't know how to handle the team and they cause drama. Theres no room for growth there at all most leaders in the stores are all Caucasian no diversity in upper management. Store Associates are constantly over worked all they offer you are free snacks and they can't even give people sufficient shifts to make a living. I've witnessed this place at its highest and its going to continue to trend downward. Honestly avoid working here the few shifts and the stress they give you aren't worth it at all.
"Pay was ok, not a good culture in the data team.",2023-03-11,"Data Scientist in San Francisco, CA",3,,Great company. Great values. Sustainable. Leading the future in this industry. Good culture.,Not a great technical team nor leaders in the technical side.

It has its ups and downs,2022-07-30,Retail Ambassador,2,,"There are some good things about working at allbirds: free shoes and merch when you join(about 2 pairs of shoes, 2 shirts, and a pair of socks), a nice hourly wage, a nice break room, and some friendly coworkers.","The management there is terrible, they have absolutely no idea what they are doing and procrastinate very often to set you up properly for the job. Their pay system is also very stupid and overcomplicated, and there are not a lot of hours to work there. You give customers marketing emails UNLESS THEY explicitly ask not to. There is no room for career growth, you get no new skillset or room for promotion in this job. The breaks are unpaid 30 minute and go by in the blink of an eye, if you want to get food from the outside, prepare to spend 20 minutes going to GET the food before actually coming back and being able to eat it."

Meh,2022-07-16,Anonymous Employee,2,,"Free shoes, free snacks, managers make good money","Company went public last year and they started putting profit before their people, despite being a B Corp.

Love the mission,2022-09-22,"Assistant Store Leader in Cambridge, MA",4,,The best part was getting to build and develop a team of awesome people,Lack of understanding/respect for retail employees from corporate departments
Corporate changed things for the worst.,2022-08-02,"Keyholder/Floor Leader in Boston, MA",1,,"A shoe discount, working for a sustainable forward company (more so than other brands at least)","-unreal corporate expectations on retail stores and staff. High turnover due to lack of competitive pay, lack of benefits and terrible management. They do not hire from within, you cannot move up because they consistently hire from outside—as in managers from completely different retail store companies. They Will tell you there is opportunities to grow, you would be naive to ignore the folks around you who came from elsewhere who are now suddenly your boss. -the benefits are terrible and are really only existent because they want to look better than other companies. Small stipend for atheistic materials, pretend available therapy that no one can use because there is only one available therapist and you have to wait weeks for an appointment. Terrible quality clothing that you are forced to wear, while not allowing for you to wear leggings or sweats that you literally sell unlike Lululemon or athleta etc. management only flys into town to see if the store Looks how it should and management looks exactly how you think it does. All male, predominantly WHITE. The amount of stores run by white men in this country says enough about allbirds and how they deem leadership material."

It’s okay,2021-10-05,"Brand Ambassador in New York, NY",3,,"(1). Free shoes + 50% product discount.  (2). Floor/stock leads are helpful. (3). Catered meetings. (4). Health, dental, and vision insurance.  (5). Company matches your 401k inputs.","(1.) Upper Management can be difficult (i.e., a regional manager often comes to the store for a walk-through and manages to say a lot of negative feedback even though sales are FLOWING and customers remain SATISFIED)… which leads to my next point:  (2). Not much is ever good enough for upper management!  (3). Too many products and not enough stock room to store them.  (4). Management expects your life to be ALL ABOUT Allbirds.  (5). Change in upper management has hindered the growth of a few colleagues… completely unfair.  (6). Not enough pay for the amount of duties managements asks for, which then sparks the next point:  (7). Not enough pay raise opportunities (quarterly bonuses do not count, but are very much appreciated).    *half of these cons did not impact or happen to me, but they are cons I have personally witnessed throughout my employment."

Also, selling a product that is genuinely giving back to the planet is the easiest thing in the world.","At least on my team, there's not a lot of age diversity (most are college students or people in their 20's).

Very cliquey environment. Lots of unnecessary gossip. No opportunities for growth. Hard work and sacrifice will be overlooked if you aren't close friends with the management here. The store I worked at did not seem to care much about actual selling capabilities. This is a great position for an indifferent high schooler or undergrad student in their freshman or sophomore year of college looking for a seasonal part-timer and a nice pair of shoes.

The World's Most Amazing Company,2019-12-18,"Floor Lead in New York, NY",5,,"Allbirds as a whole is an incredible, innovative company that holds such a special place in my heart! I've always worked for smaller businesses, afraid of branching out to bigger brands because of all the horror stories I've heard from fellow friends and family. But, here at Allbirds, it's all good. Everyone at HQ is a sweetheart and they are so easy to talk to! I've met many people from corporate in the outside world and they have always left a bad taste in my mouth - but, again, that is not at all the case with the workers at Allbirds. I can not fully and properly describe my love for working with these amazing humans. Tim and Joey are true modern day superheroes who deeply care for their employees and the Earth. Their philosophy brings together a fantastic team of good-doers who just want to make the world a better place; they're all so supportive and welcoming, I am so grateful to be working for such a phenomenal company. I love how sustainable we are, I love the community, I love how we have a #doglovers channel on Slack and that everyone is super interactive with each other. Allbirds is an absolute gem of a corporation (who is B certified by the way, haaaaay!). Thank you everybody for always being so amazing. Ya'll are truly inspiring and the best! :-)",Nothing really!

Better things in a better way,2018-08-28,"Software Engineer in San Francisco, CA",5,,"I was drawn to Allbirds' strong commitment to the values that founded the company and to the higher-level goal of making better things in a better way - with a focus on environmental sustainability while making quality products.  There is a strong culture of transparency and trust across the teams.  Our founders/CEOs are very communicative and approachable.  The company is still relatively small for the level of impact we've had so teams are tight-knit, with lots of challenges and opportunities to grow with the company.  Among the software engineering team, the typical Allbirds engineer is very curious and driven but very collaborative as well.","The company is growing, but at this stage it can often feel like there is more work to do than there are people to do it."

"Great intentions, but disappointing results",2019-04-25,Anonymous Employee,2,,"- Great snacks, happy hours, and catered lunch (not daily) - Mission driven - Will be a key player in the sustainability world; actually value making an impact and disrupting the industry - Genuinely tries to keep company culture intact as they continue to grow - Random field trips and company wide sponsored events plus cool guest speakers at company wide all hands - There are some great individuals who are talented, knowledgeable, and down to earth","- Little transparency. The company lacks transparency when it comes to salaries, promotions, and executive/management decisions. - People are surprisingly laid off often and there are absolutely no rational explanations. People begin to gossip and no one feels they have job security unless you're close to the executives.  - The people&talent team does not convey a friendly and open environment and is quick to dismiss or ignore your concerns. - The people team is so focused on company expansion/hiring that the growth and development of the employees is majorly overlooked.  - You're most likely extremely overworked and thrown 100s of projects which is typical in a startup environment, but positive reinforcement/recognition is either not demonstrated or used to dismiss the reality of the challenges and struggles everyone is feeling.  - Can get political as favoritism can definitely come into play - Constant mistakes are made because people are stretched too thin doing tons of things at less then 100%"

Customer Support Associate,2018-09-06,Customer Support Associate,4,,"- A company that is constantly looking for making better things in a better way  - You work with very intelligent and hard-working people. They are always down to help and keep you motivated. Your team becomes one of your best friends here - Catered lunch on Wednesdays (Twice a week during Nov - Jan holiday period) - Comprehensive three-week training process (paid) - Free Shoes! - Company updates are amazing to hear - Your team will always have your back - Location of HQ is convenient (via BART, Ferry, MUNI) - Managers/Lead are there to always help and improve the quality of your work","- Constant shake-ups on important events - must be ready to adapt and work in a fast-paced environment - There is very limited room for growth except for management positions, and although they do their best to present opportunities for special projects and specialized roles within the CX department, the nature of this job is just one that makes it hard to find any variety in the day-to-day work - The startup ambiance is changing to be more corporate feeling- there is still fun to be had, but it is starting to get more regulated - Sometimes leaving committed employees feeling undervalued and neglected - Salary is way too low for the volume of work, but it's the people that make the biggest difference in your workday and make you never want to leave! - If it matters - the snack bar is small and emptied out mid-week (easy fix though)"
