recommend Twitter 1.0 but not 2.0,2023-04-25,"Data Scientist II in San Francisco, CA",5,,Great people and team in Twitter 1.0,People are too nice and leadership doesn't have a clear vision
"Destroyed - dumpster fire, don’t touch with a ten foot pole",2023-02-08,"Vice President in San Francisco, CA",1,,"This used to be an awesome place to work where leadership respected employees and welcomed feedback. We all worked together for one goal and the good of the team. Was it perfect? No, we should have dispensed with jacks services the first time around and not let him back in. But this was the most authentic place I’ve worked and I learned so much. It was a fantastic company warts and all.","When I quit this hell hole in Nov (yes I left of my own accord) this place was as toxic as you could ever imagine. Elons lack of comms or expertise in social media, his inept management team who’ve never had an original thought in their lives (elon says this, elon says that) spouting absolute nonsense to tenured experts were embarrassing themselves at every turn. Personally I left a huge amount of $$$ on the table because I simply couldn’t bear to spend another minute with this bunch and I absolutely pity the remaining folks who unfortunately are mostly there to keep their visas or because they have financial obligation. If you love to work in an atmosphere of fear, listening to utter tripe come out of leaderships mouths and don’t want to be treated like a human or value any kind of diversity or empathy (or business sense) then this is the place for you."
Elon Musk ruined the company,2023-04-27,"Senior ML Engineer in San Francisco, CA",1,,"Fast paced, good comp, still good reputation in terms of scale","Toxic leadership trickles down to toxic workplace environment. Everybody whispers in the office, and everybody is scared of Elon."
Disappointing Culture for a Junior Fullstack Web Developer,2023-02-27,"Developer in New York, NY",3,,The pay was competitive and many coworkers were very talented and supportive.,"As a junior fullstack web developer at this marketing tech startup, I was hoping for a supportive and innovative culture to grow my skills. Unfortunately, my experience was far from that. The company had a culture of overworking and undervaluing its employees. I often felt like my contributions were not appreciated or recognized. The management team had poor communication skills, and it was challenging to get clear guidance on projects. Moreover, there was a lack of diversity and inclusion within the company. The team was predominantly male and lacked representation from underrepresented groups. Overall, I was disappointed with the culture of this company. As a junior fullstack web developer, I was hoping for a supportive and inclusive environment to grow my skills, but instead, I felt undervalued and underutilized. I would not recommend this company to others."
HR,2023-04-27,"Sr. HR Coordinator in San Francisco, CA",1,,The people and culture was the best I’ve ever experienced,The takeover changed everything that was good about Twitter
"Twitter destroyed, avoid",2023-04-17,Developer Relations Manager,3,,"Good for a chaotic culture, vacuum opportunities","No strategy, plans are fraught and not communicated well. Benefits taken away over time. Hardcore work and hours, sleeping in the office required."
Job review,2023-04-21,"Staff Software Engineer in New York, NY",5,,"Great environment: days off, libations in the office, gym allowance",Too liberal of a work force
"Very technical work, great learnings, No work life balance",2023-03-01,"Senior Software Engineer in San Francisco, CA",3,,"1] The company has fired it's 85% of its engineers. Thus the area of responsibility has increased drastically per person. 2] You start seeing the whole picture instead of the walls of your responsibility when working at this level. 3] Leveled up at least by one notch - senior eng her works at staff level of faang companies, swe 2 works at senior level, and so on.","1] Hostile environment, everyone wonders when will they get fired for no reason 2] The extra work comes without the extra pay"
Terrible place to work,2023-04-23,Chief Executive Officer (CEO),1,,The CEO is hilarious and makes everyone laugh.,The employees are lazy and are sometimes mean to CEO and hurt his feelings.

What you thought,2023-03-24,"Marketing Specialist in San Francisco, CA",1,,I can now recognize leadership styles to avoid.,Ever changing environment that really sped up at the end.
"Great mission, scattered execution",2022-06-27,Director,4,,"Great perks including full menu of remote work options, unlimited PTO, monthly ""days of rest"" and meeting-free focus weeks, exceptionally talented and committed people, and you'll be working on an unparalleled and unique mission with significant implications for the health of society across the globe.","1) Elon Musk is buying it, maybe. There is zero clarity about what the company will be and what roles and skills will be in demand or on the chopping block if the deal closes and Twitter becomes a private company. 2) This company operates in the glare of public scrutiny like no other, literally all decisions are subject to intense debate and second-guessing from millions of people with scant context of the challenges involved in managing a social media platform at the scale and speed of Twitter. 3) There may not ever be as big a business here as Wall St. wants, management has been twisting itself into pretzels trying to figure out how to increase growth and revenue with only modest progress to date, and a lot of it boils down to trying to be less like Twitter and more like competitors like TikTok. 4) Teams, org structures and goals are in constant flux, providing little continuity for people on the front lines."
Mostly great - just needed better leadership,2022-11-10,"Creative Director in Los Angeles, CA",4,,"• People: The culture is phenomenal. The best people I've ever worked with - talent and personality. • Perks: All around, one of the best places for a good work/life balance • The brand is fun and great to be part of",• Leadership really lacked clarity in where we were going as a company • Very poor management and process - often times too many people on a project and unclear who is approving things
Super bad,2023-03-20,"Software Engineer in San Francisco, CA",1,,You will get the chance to code a lot since you will be evaluated based on the lines of code you wrote,Elon is a super bad CEO and Twitter culture sucks
Great Company to work for (Pre-Elon),2022-12-04,Software Engineer,5,,"- Lots of great benefits/expenses (gym, wifi, phone, wellness) - I didn't have to work over the normal 9-5 most of the times - There are a lot of great mentors and helpful people",- I only worked there as a new grad for a year. I didn't really have any huge complaints. Maybe I wish there was a better structure for new grads and onboarding in general.
Good,2023-02-02,Site Ops Tech,4,,Great Opportunity and growth within,No downside. Lack of benefits
Was the best company to work at,2023-01-18,"Software Engineer-1 in San Francisco, CA",5,,"Amazing coworkers, benefits, work-life balance",There were no downsides to working here prior to Elon Musk.

data scientist at Twitter,2023-03-02,"Data Scientist in San Francisco, CA",3,,"before acquisition, it's a great place with great culture and colleagues.","no vision as a company after acquisition, and no long term plans"
Strange times,2022-12-16,Senior Program Manager,2,,Little at this point but some good and hard working people left from pre-acquisition who strive to maintain a supportive and inclusive environment,"Love or hate CEO, huge swaths of teams and employees laid off recently with unclear reasoning. No firm company vision or OKRs, intense work culture. Terminations in the middle of the night, leadership emails at any time of day or night on any day of the week with short turnaround expectations. Overall it’s the worse company environment I’ve ever seen after a decade in corporate tech. Company seems to be in a downward spiral."
Not same anymore,2023-02-07,"Group Product Manager in Seattle, WA",1,,"Opportunity, interesting scope, impact, talent and comp","Lack of leaders, no vision, terrible culture."
Great place to grow,2022-10-14,Senior Program Manager,3,,Lots of opportunity to take on new challenges to help the business and your own growth. Ownership and autonomy on initiatives is empowering.,"Certain leaders with too much tenure are no longer effective. What worked for them and the team years ago, isn't helping Twitter mature now.

Was great before Elon,2022-12-21,Sr. Software Engineer,4,,"Great work-life balance. Smart, fun coworkers. Cool technology and challenges.","Unfortunately Jack over-hired during covid and couldn't show anything for it, leaving the company in a position where it had few options"

Culture Shift,2022-11-21,"Senior Strategy and Operations Manager in San Francisco, CA",3,,"Brilliant colleagues, good individual teams, excellent projects.",Twitter Culture had a dramatic shift in the past years even before Jack left. You could tell we were less employees and more numbers.
New management is horrible,2022-12-28,"Research Analyst in San Francisco, CA",1,,There used to be a fantastic culture,The new culture is toxic and seeks to burn employees out
Mess,2022-11-15,"Senior TPM in Atlanta, GA",1,,Twitter was in the process of building more innovative features/products to put on the platform.,"Elon Musk is there now and he's screwing everything up. It's apparent, he's no project/product/program/engineering manager but he's trucking along as if he is. All knowledge he's perceived to have is someone else's knowledge he stole."

Was a great company before Musk,2022-11-14,Account Manager,3,,Really enjoyed Twitter and the company culture. My team salary the benefits literally everything.,Elon Musk had nothing better to do but to ruin everything.
Avoid,2022-06-04,Global TA Manager,2,,"There are some really smart and passionate people on the team. The benefits are really inclusive and expansive. Not the best in the industry but probably the most inclusive that I’ve seen. WFH and culture around giving back, volunteering. Employee first culture in HR - if your manager is a jerk they will get coached and held accountable ultimately.",Extreme favoritism - most promotions not based on actual performance. Toxic work culture - think the movie Mean Girls Dog eat dog culture that encourages back stabbing and theft of intellectual property. Low emotional IQ of TA senior leadership. VP is untrustworthy and has not demonstrated the capability to build execute or properly communicate. Not inclusive to introverts or neurodivergent personalities Instability of hostile takeover.

Great place to work (Pre-Covid),2022-09-22,ML Engineer,5,,A leader that cares about a diverse workforce and the wellbeing of his employees,Not the best tech stack compared to other top tech companies
Not a collaborative workplace,2022-09-29,Engineering Manager,1,,+ some unique technical design and architecture challenges due to volume,+ team members are very focused on being 'staffed' on projects that will earn them a promotion. + this detracts from an overall focus on the success of a team

Great Environment,2022-05-16,"Anonymous Employee in San Francisco, CA",5,,* one of the best companies to work for in terms of people * interesting technical challenges,* hard to convince people of new ways * things move slowly
Lack of Accountability,2022-05-18,Staff Technical Program Manager,2,,"Great perks, good PTO policy and benefits. Good compensation.",The lack of accountability at all levels makes it extremely difficult to operate as a TPM.

Your career is doomed if you join this company in your prime. If you start taking lot of proactiveness, you will instantly shut down with bureaucracy, Truly Mediocre middle management, all they care about is Head Count Growth and increasing their Team Strength at the cost of Company money and Ads revenue. No accountability, no threat to their job. One of the worst managed company I have ever worked for. If you are looking to learn and career growth, trust me this is not the company for you."

Lots of space to grow!! IF you are ok with ambiguity.,2021-02-09,"Project Manager I in San Francisco, CA",5,,"Lots of available opportunities and room to create your own growth. Twitter acts much like a start up still in ways, and i've found that you can grow and expend your career based on how willing you are to come up with business justification, find areas of improvement, etc","Maybe not as common for others, but lots of manager changes. Not because managers are leaving, but because of constant reshuffling."
#LoveWhereYouWork,2021-07-06,Anonymous Employee,5,,- great culture - they really do something about the diversity,- too many politics - slow velocity
Color of your badge matters,2020-12-03,"Anonymous Employee in San Francisco, CA",3,,"For the most part your colleagues and your internal stakeholders will be fully transparent with you. Making the shift from in office work to remote was also incredibly smooth so kudos to leadership for taking that shift in stride. If you are an FTE aka a blue badge life is great. There was job security throughout the pandemic and days of rest/ holidays and of course the all important unlimited PTO which you could use for mental health days, sick days, etc. unfortunately if you didn’t have a blue badge, life at twitter is quite different.","As mentioned above if you are not a blue badge aka a full time employee (FTE) and are instead a full time contingent worker (40-45 hours/week for a fixed term) life isn’t great. First and foremost Twitter identifies contingent workers with green badges instead of blue. All in all not a big deal but people do take notice. Additionally Twitter encourages everyone to show up as their authentic self. This is some what laughable to those of us in the green badge ranks because if we show up with anything less than perfection (regardless of circumstance) you are cut loose. For example, when the pandemic started, everyone was told we would not have layoffs or pay cuts. That was true for blue badge employees but for those with green badges, if your contract expired and you were doing well, you were still terminated. (This was amended later to contract extensions but no conversions but a lot of people lost their jobs). Additionally I was sold on working a contract based on being able to work 45 hours a week with 5 of those hours being over time aka time and a half. When the pandemic started I along with my other contingent colleagues were told we could no longer work 45 hours but we were still expected to produce the same metrics. This essentially forced us into a pay cut of almost 20%. Again not something our FTE colleagues ever had to worry about. Twitter encourages everyone to show up authentically and to take care of themselves but when you are not given paid time off (literally no vacation) and are in a constant state of anxiety over whether or not you are going to hit your metrics it’s tough to show up authentically. I work constantly and I’m always scared if I’m next to be let go because of the color of my badge. If you have a blue badge you’re golden but definitely don’t join if they offer a contract to hire role."
Great work life balance,2021-06-21,"Senior Software Engineer in San Francisco, CA",4,,"Great work life balance, great benefits, reimburse phone and Internet.",not very competitive pay. 401k contribution is kinda sad

Join,2021-05-12,"Human Resources Manager in New York, NY",4,,AMazing place to work. Apply today!,"Silo's, Immature managers, Not the best place for non- white employee's."
"Almost great, but too many politics",2020-10-05,"Senior Director in San Francisco, CA",3,,Benefits and the people are generally really good. The work is interesting and important. The company REALLY cares about its impact on the world.,"Extremely indecisive. Executives and managers don't have control of their people or the work they do. Significant lack of rigor or goals oriented awards - promotions and advancement are primarily based on who you know. Topmost leaders at the company are at generally well meaning, but don't seem to be committed to a transparent, objective approach to managing priorities and funding. D&I focus is good, but over the top to the point of encouraging constant witch hunts."

Twitter Account Manager,2021-01-26,Account Manager,4,,"Amazing culture, benefits, and people.",Very strict rules and regulations as an employee. If you haven't been at the company for 5+ years there isn't strong career growth potential.
Medium but still growing fast,2021-02-28,"Senior ML Engineer in San Francisco, CA",5,,Inclusive culture; active product changes,Techniques are some how out of date.
Amazing company to work for,2021-01-31,Director,5,,"Truly care about employees, invest in people with training/education and great values.",Turing into a huge company has the ability to stifle creativity.
Dysfunctional and stressful,2021-02-18,Product Manager,2,,"Work like balance, brand, nice coworkers","Poor leadership, below market comp, constantly changing strategy, demoralizing work enviorment"
Great work environment,2021-03-01,Technical Recruiter,5,,Great work/life balance Great leadership Great mission,Could have better tools and systems
HR is invisible; managers aren't there to help you grow in any meaningful way and sometimes they hurt,2014-03-19,"Software Engineer in San Francisco, CA",3,,"Food, working with many very qualified and mostly ego-less engineers who really care about what they are doing, running a service that people care about, plenty to learn","Your happiness or sadness will depend almost entirely on whether the manager who owns you wants you to be happy or sad, whether they want you to stay or don't care if you disappear tomorrow. There is no obvious way to correct things if you are identified as a ""problem"". Every team has a completely different style, which accounts for the giddy reviews found elsewhere in this section. The hiring rally in 2013 made it much easier to dispose of people rather than solving problems so they could stay."
"Don't believe the BS, this is a company with huge opportunities",2015-08-30,"Director in San Francisco, CA",5,,"It's one of the few companies that really touches a huge number of regular people on a global scale. So much has been made of its user base vs Facebook, but if you've got 300+ million people using your product, you're doing *something* right. Every week, we hear scores of news stories about how Twitter played a part in changing something, helping people recognize some truth, or just help people have fun. People here are smart, but also relatable and compassionate. I've been at other big tech companies that had super-smart people, but they were much more unapproachable or prone to hole up in their work and not socialize. After DickC's departure, management seems to have really rallied around one another, which in my view is 100 percent attributable to Jack's leadership and moral authority. Management leveled out expectations with Wall Street after Q2, which caused short term pain but gives us runway to succeed in the long term.

These folks are so upbeat, optimistic and passionate about the product it makes you want to invest your own money into the company.  Senior management does a terrific job of talking about high-level goals and accomplishments on a bi-weekly basis. The vibe during those meetings is electrifying, thanks in part to the CEO Dick Costolo who's both energetic and hilarious.  Ideas put forward by non-managers/VPs, including those from projects that happen during a quarterly hack week, are also taking seriously. There are forums where such ideas are discussed, and when appropriate they're adopted into the product.  Last but not least, there are tons of amazing perks including 3x/day free meals prepared by a world class chef (seriously, you have to try it), free beer on tap, lots of activities/classes, etc.","Some people might be put off by the narrow pyramid of direct reports reaching up to the CEO, i.e. there are too many layers separating most employees from the CEO in comparison to some other companies."

Lots of change and growth - can be jarring if you're not accustom to this kind of environment.","- While communication is generally open, it can be hard to find the right channels to get information (I still struggle with this). - Internal tools aren't always a priority to help improve productivity (although I've been spoiled by Google's in a prior life). - Some whining and entitlement issues from a vocal (and often anonymous) few.  - Unclear growth and development path for managers (but people are working on this). - Constant growing pains.

No cogs here!,2015-08-17,"Engineering Manager in San Francisco, CA",5,,"If you like being a cog in a larger machine, then steer clear of Twitter/TellApart. This is one of the few places where I've been able to ramp insanely fast in terms of impact and responsibility. There are different challenges every day and plenty of opportunities for me to give feedback into Twitter/TellApart's future products and processes. The team is the best I have ever worked with...full stop. TellApart's bar for new hires is extremely high, but that has made the environment extremely positive. There have been plenty of blog posts regarding Twitter's ""morale problem"" but it's generally overblown. There are also too many perks to mention. In general, we are VERY well taken care of.","There have been quite a few shake-ups in senior management, but for the most part this hasn't affected my day-to-day. I am still optimistic about Twitter's future. Twitter/TellApart is not a place for people that need to be told what to do everyday. You should consider Twitter/TellApart if you lean more towards ""asking forgiveness rather than permission"" mindset.

There is a free shuttle to the Bay Area... and, oh, yes - the IPO worked very well for employees, as far as I can tell.","It's difficult to find high-quality engineers and especially managers these days. I feel like the two managers added recently to my extended group are not extremely technically sharp.

Love working at Twitter because the product matters to the world,2016-07-16,"Software Engineer in San Francisco, CA",5,,"If you love Twitter and what it stands for, it's a motivating place to work. Twitter is simultaneously making solid improvements to its core product while investing in some invigorating new areas like live video, AR/VR, and AI/computer vision. I've noticed an increasing number of new hires from places like Google, Facebook, Uber, and others lately which indicates that interest is strong.   Food is awesome at lunch time (not quite so much at dinner, but it's solid). HQ is a nice place to work.   At least on my team, management is very good at recognizing good work and promoting quickly.","There are visible departures of well liked people, most of whom seem to be leaving for smaller startups. I feel that this is a natural part of one's career, but it can still be disappointing when people who are admired and who care about Twitter still choose to leave.  Work on some teams can be slow due to a paranoia about experimenting to make sure metrics aren't hurt. I feel that leadership needs to be bolder in shipping to prevent churning and inefficiency."

The compensation and perks are wonderful—and though my work/life balance occasionally teeters against my favor—my workload is generally respected. I am incredibly optimistic about our future—and I strongly believe I can be at Twitter for a long time, as inter-department and office transfer is strongly supported.  Leadership constantly stresses the importance of the employees—their contributions are highlighted, and I get the sense that our satisfaction is paramount. It's really easy to do your best work here.","I feel like any ""cons"" at Twitter are nit-picking. As the company grows, it's harder to find the information you need (though they're working on that), or the people with whom you need to speak. The rapid pace of the business means we make mistakes that we don't always own up to externally, even though we'd like to. Internal critiques can be occasionally be brutal, and externally we're an easy target for the media (it can be tough to ignore).

Ad Ops Support Specialist (Contractor),2018-03-04,"Ad Ops Support Specialist (Contractor) in San Francisco, CA",2,,"For anyone interested in Advertising Operations within start-ups & bigger tech companies, this role provides really good introductory exposure to the general processes & terms.   As far as general perks - the company also has free breakfast & lunch with 3 different cafeterias & a huge variety of food (which obviously doesn't hurt).   To be transparent, I think just having the title ""Twitter"" listed on my resume was the most I gained from this job (which is saying a lot because I worked there for a year).","Management wise – I think there’s a pretty strong lack of communication & clarity throughout the Ad Ops department on a lot of different things. Going into this role, I assumed that there would be a very in-depth few weeks of training on the entire system of Twitter’s Ad Ops Department, as well as the products they supported. Instead, it was turned out to be 2 days of very general/vague Powerpoint slides, accompanied by the popular slogan “just mess around with it”. After those 2 days of training, it’s like they just assume you’ll learn everything else on your own. This may work for some people, but definitely didn’t seem to be the most productive method in my opinion. Since I started, I think the training process has improved with new Videos they’ve implemented, but I think there’s still a really difficult learning curve for people coming into the role largely caused by the training process not being as thorough as it can be. Managers & Superiors will often say you can always ask them if you have questions, but from my personal experience, I sometimes felt like it became obvious when you broke past their patience level with one too many questions. And again, I think the need for new people to ask so many questions in the first place could be prevented with a much more thorough training process.  As far as the culture of the Office, I think there’s one gigantic elephant in the room: the Contractor vs Full Time Employee (FTE) distinction. Going into this role, you begin as a Contractor employee, meaning you work full time (40 hours per week) but you’re paid hourly (rather than salary) & don’t receive as many benefits. From my own time here, I think I feel pretty confident in saying that the majority of people really don’t want to be a Contractor employee. Most (if not all) people would prefer the FTE title if eligible. However, it never feels like anyone in Management is proactively looking at your potential & recommending you apply to specific FTE roles. They never mention any current FTE openings or offer any constructive feedback about what’s needed to be an FTE. You really have to do it 100% on your own. They estimate that around 1/3 of employees eventually become eligible for conversion to Full Time, but I only noticed a very small select few that this occurred for during my time there.  Speaking from my own personal experience – I only received positive feedback on my work during my time there, but was still never recommended an opening for an FTE role or personal advice for how to progress professionally. This sometimes just made it feel like you were working a thankless job, where no one was really noticing what you were doing. And a lot of the FTE work was 100% in the scope of Contractors to be able to perform once given sufficient training. One could even argue that some of the work processes you do as a Contractor are just as challenging as the FTE work. Thus, it essentially creates a feeling where the work space is very clique-based dividing Contractors & FTEs. Management frequently say that they appreciate your work & everything you do, but in the same breath will explain that only FTEs are eligible for certain perks/outside of work events."

Very clicky and must drink the Twitter kool-aid to be heard. Very strange for what is supposed to be a progressive environment. People talk the same, sound the same, only accept one style of work methodologies. Also, poor senior management to director levels. Too green, not seasoned and again, all talk the same, walk the same and act the same. Though they preach to be transparent and open, there is very little listening and of course, no execution when someone is being heard. This is a big reason Twitter is struggling. Instead of building a unique environment where all types of thinking are challenged and welcomed, you must conform to things like walking with someone to the bathroom to ensure you make contact and connections with someone. Really? And you better believe that an unseasoned manager will call you out on it too.   Better yet, what about the management that preaches but then takes advantage of the company at every turn. They pass along work so they can work out at the gym for 1.5 hours or talk about their personal problems in a professional workplace. Out of control and there is very little accountability. The funny thing is the people that work hard, smart and can help achieve greater success are forgotten or run over by those manipulative, untruthful and power hungry for themselves."
