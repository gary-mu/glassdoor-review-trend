Great company with authentic people,2022-12-20,Product Development & Strategy Lead,5,,Great benefits Remote work Inspiring mission,Work hours could get intense as deadlines approached
They're trying to figure it out,2023-04-14,Anonymous Employee,2,,"- Employees are awesome: super smart and kind. All around great humans. - Lots of flexibility in term of scheduling - In my experience, workload was seasonal: you had busy times and you had down time. The overall predictability was nice -- but after the first round of layoffs, there was a lot of business uncertainty and too much work to do with not enough staff, and no comp adjustments.","- Reforge used to be a great place to work! But in the last 6 months, the business hit some snags and culture + vision took a dive. - Leadership has been trying all sorts of different company directions + ideas to see what sticks - 2 rounds of layoffs within a short period of time. If you're thinking about joining the team, maybe think twice. - Boys' club at the top"
Sinking ship,2023-04-13,Anonymous Employee,1,,"The company has a talented and supportive team that values collaboration and mutual respect, creating a positive and inclusive work environment.","- Opportunities for growth seem limited, with only a select few receiving multiple promotions within a year. - Executives make decisions without fully considering their impact on people's lives. - Change is a constant occurrence, often leading to sudden shifts in direction and a feeling of whiplash. - Communication from upper management is lacking. - The ""boy club"" mentality within the company tends to push out truly talented individuals."
"Was great, not sure about now",2023-04-19,"Strategy & Ops Manager in New York, NY",3,,Still believe in the CEO and still one of the best batches of people I’ve worked with.,"After 2 rounds of layoffs, the process, outcomes, and direction thereafter remains opaque and unclear."
OK Experience,2023-03-17,Team Lead,3,,"Smart people, phenomenal content, very transparent",Remote work + deep work time made things lonely
"Good and Bad, but Mostly Good",2022-08-18,Anonymous Employee,4,,"This team is phenomenal. The culture is great. That is due to clear direction from the top. Thank you Brian, and the rest of the leadership team for making it clear that a healthy work culture is a top priority. We're a fully remote company. You're not punished for not keeping to ""core hours"", which is tricky but is essentially rubbish. Also, very clear direction from leadership with sharing where the company is going and how. It's pretty great! What's nice is that a lot of companies say they can't find diverse talent, Reforge does and those candidates get through the recruiting pipeline and get offers.","Due to the economy, they've cut a lot of things like headcount, allowances for socializing, and the budget for team offsites. However, the leadership team still meets frequently for offsites. The leadership team also gets access to coaching and other perks. Maybe some of those perks have changed, but I would say the rank and file don’t have visibility into those changes. Learning and development for the rank and file also doesn't exist beyond Reforge content. I'd like to see cuts hit leadership too if it's hitting the rest of the team."
"Confused team, uncertain product",2023-01-17,"Strategy Lead in Los Angeles, CA",1,,"Smart, enthusiastic people at all levels (except the top).",This is a learning company that wants to be a platform company. No clear vision or strategy from the top. Boy’s club execs.
An incredibly rewarding place to work,2021-06-15,"Senior Recruiter in New York, NY",5,,"- A team that is ""overqualified"" for the roles they're doing. Everyone is so intelligent and so driven, it's infectious - A product that has grown naturally, and that is actually addressing a serious need in society, it's easy to be passionate about what you're building - Leadership is accessible, transparent, and relatable. It's so common with Silicon Valley Startups to see egos or friction at the top, and Reforge just isn't like that. I also love the way messaging is presented from the top down, there's always a Why, an explanation of thought process and journey, and an opportunity to discuss and ask questions. It creates a really inclusive and collaborative environment. - Series A funded, but even before that Reforge was profitable in the Millions (!!!) - This company genuinely provides work/life balance, and knows how to operate a remote team. Expectations are high but realistic, and above all else your time - both personal and professional - is valued.  - Seems small but actually makes a big difference: they're willing to spend money on software, hardware, supplies, really anything if you're able to provide why it will help you do your job better.","- Almost all communication is done over video, rarely do we just have phone calls. I personally see the importance and value in physically seeing someone on-screen (because we are a remote org) but I can see how some people haven't adjusted to Zoom life yet and therefore it can feel a little uncomfortable. Positive here is that all your coworkers are understanding so even if you feel that way, you'll feel welcomed :)"
"Ownership, autonomy, supportive team",2021-06-14,Product Strategy Lead,5,,"-100% remote and set up well for asynchronous collaboration - Everyone has deep work time on their calendar, so you can actually get work done during the workday - Leadership team is extremely transparent and accessible. I've never felt in the dark about big strategic changes or financial considerations. The leaders also really like getting strategic questions. I feel comfortable asking questions if I don't understand a decision they've made vs shamed for ""not understanding"" or ""not being strategic enough"" - They take an Amazon-style approach for content-heavy meetings where everyone reads a pre-read document in detail and shares comments ahead of time. This makes for really productive live discussions and honestly more thoughtful work. I'm usually comfortable talking my way through things, and I've had to put a lot more rigor of thought into the ideas I share at Reforge - Exposure and collaboration opportunities with impressive thought-leaders in tech. - The culture on the team is really motivating for me personally. Everyone on the team is encouraged and expected to take ownership of their work, operate autonomously, and be proactive if they need help.","It's a seasonal business, so when it's busy, it's REALLY busy (typically when program cohorts are happening in the spring and fall). I wasn't expecting such a drastic, concentrated impact. It has been manageable because I know when it's coming and can plan for it, but it's my main frustration."
"Transparency, very healthy work culture, would highly recommend",2021-06-14,"Recruiting Coordinator in Flagstaff, AZ",5,,"So so many: -great candidate experience: transparent, respectful, rigorous, but leadership truly values making sure the candidate fits our culture but also that the role will work for their careers and lifestyles -supportive onboarding: encourages autonomy but also v helpful. VERY welcoming teams. People are happy here and it shows. -flexible timing/PTO seems to truly work in favor of employee productivity and happiness -mad respect to the CEO as he walks The Walk when it comes to transparency, valuing employee experience, and explaining reasoning behind business decisions. -GREAT benefits including equity -everyone that works here is intimidatingly intelligent AND kind/funny/cool, it's a pleasure to be part of an amazing team that is growing quickly -even with a fully remote org, much thought and intention has been put into forging connections and creating an inclusive atmosphere.",None yet; to be determined!
Thoughtful leadership and great growth opportunities,2021-06-15,Strategy Lead,5,,"I've had a great experience at Reforge.  - The leadership is transparent and thoughtful - they communicate all strategic decisions and are open to questions about it  - There's a lot of autonomy to work the way you want, the remote work culture is really setup for success, enabling opportunities to work together, get to know each other, and work alone.  - As a team member working on building programs, it really feels like you have the opportunity to influence the growth of the company, which is so empowering - I especially love the people I work with - everybody is really nice, friendly and so great at what they do.","Busy times can get very busy, and the remote work experience isn't for everybody"
Great place to work,2021-06-21,Anonymous Employee,5,,"I think Reforge is a phenomenal place to work. We are a truly remote company where impact matters, not how much time you spend at your desk. It is very transparent - our business metrics are share and accessible to the team, our strategy is clearly laid out in written documents and covered by our executive team, and new ideas are encouraged and rewarded. The company has been growing like crazy and there are tons of opportunities to take on additional responsibility and grow your career.","The company did company retreats twice a year pre-covid and tries to foster a sense of community, but if you want to be in an office it's not the company for you (we don't have an office)."
"Impactful product, healthy remote/distributed culture and team",2021-06-15,Senior Software Engineer,5,,"It's easy to be proud of what we're providing to our members, and the company does an excellent job of cultivating a healthy, active, psychologically safe culture. The remote/distributed nature of the team means excellent communication and positive attitudes are a must, and the company has done a stellar job of hiring for that and supporting it. I love working with these people and I'm truly proud of the product. Exciting problems to be solving for right now too.","Inevitable growing pains at the phase we're at right now, scaling our teams and product very quickly. Depending on proclivities, this could be exciting for some potential candidates, uncomfortable for others."
"Amazing ppl, well balanced, transparent",2021-06-23,Anonymous Employee,4,,"This company attracts amazing talent, the people at Reforge are the best part. I appreciate that work/life balance is encouraged and actually seems to exist. Leadership is transparent.","Like any startup, change is constant - strategies change, priorities change and sometimes it's hard to make meaningful progress with constant change. But the perk of this ""con"" is being agile and able to make the right changes quickly!"
Building something special,2021-06-15,"Content Designer in San Francisco, CA",5,,"Lots of opportunity to make an impact in this fast-growing startup, remote-first envionrment. The people are special at Reforge. The team is passionate, hard-working, and checks ego at the door.",Remote culture can take some adjustment (but also offers plenty of flexibility).
Really Great Fully Remote Workplace,2021-06-14,"Data Engineer in Truckee, CA",5,,- Remote first company - Very positive and inclusive culture - Small company -> high velocity - Great people,- High expectations for individual performance - Remote first company (if you prefer working in an office)
"Driven, unified team on an exciting upward trajectory",2021-01-14,Designer,5,,"The team is top notch and all incredibly easy to get along with, and everyone expertly manages a remote work environment","Seasonal ebbs & flows of workload, as well as some frequent re-jiggering of plans as the company grows, but all are far outweighed by the pros"
Reforge,2023-04-09,Engineering,4,,Reforge is a great place to work,There are too many meetings
admin,2022-04-07,Administrative Assistant,1,,salary and flexible schedule are the pros,lack of communication and transparency
