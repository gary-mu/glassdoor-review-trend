"Great mission, improving culture",2022-05-17,"Senior Program Officer in Seattle, WA",5,,Opportunity to work with amazing people on some complex and important global and domestic challenges.  Increasingly intentional focus on inclusive culture and equitable partnerships.,"Hectic and political work environment, and priorities are still set from the top so a lot of time spent managing up."
Great benefits,2023-04-03,"Senior Business Analyst in Seattle, WA",5,,"Fun team environment, great benefits","Sometime ambiguous job duties, need better role clarity"
Great work but poor management,2023-02-05,"Program Officer in Seattle, WA",3,,Lots of smart talented people who are trying to move the needle in the best way they know and can.,"Upper management skews towards private sector backgrounds - management consulting, big pharma and may not have the technical expertise or insights to lead global health or development work."
Great mission,2023-03-14,"Senior Program Officer, Global Health in Seattle, WA",4,,Amazing working on great mission. Extremely fulfilling.,"Demanding job, but not really a con for someone who is driven."
"No heart, no soul",2022-07-01,"Senior Program Officer in Seattle, WA",2,,Access to resources to invest in important areas,"Constant layoffs and turnover due to consultant-driven strategy changes every couple of years. Institution does not care about employees, no effort to grow or retain, sees no value in institutional knowledge or mature relationships with partners and grantees. No logic, no values to layoffs. Behind the times in many areas because listening to consultants with no content expertise rather than technical experts on staff. Despite the rhetoric, extremely risk averse in grant-making. Delegation of authority (everything above 5 M needs approval at the Presidential level) leads to huge bottlenecks and very slow process--approx. 1 year to make a grant... whether it's for 5 million or 30 million--despite the fact that they obsess about strategy, have yearly portfolio reviews, etc."
strong mission but difficult culture,2022-11-17,"Anonymous Employee in Seattle, WA",3,,"Mission, salary, amazing benefits, almost unparalleled opportunity for global impact, network, access to major field leaders","competitive culture, bureaucracy, cookie cutter mold for internal success and advancement, lack of diversity in leadership, not enough time for true innovation and collaboration, pays lip service only to employee reported burnout. Lots of flux right now with governance changes and what it will mean for the organization's future mission and culture."
Program Officer,2023-01-29,"Associate Program Officer in Washington, DC",4,,"Benefits, working with smart people",Confusing org structure and a lot of ambiguity
great pay and benefits; each team has a different culture,2022-01-16,"Senior Program Officer in Seattle, WA",4,,"Pay and benefits are fantastic. These include six months of paid parental leave (although it used to be a full year) and a contribution to one's retirement fund of 15% your salary. In effect, this means that compensation is 15% higher that the salaries you see quoted. Also, if you work and live in Washington state, there's no state income tax. They have some very talented and experienced people at the foundation, and the mission, of course, is a very fulfilling and meaningful one. The foundation also has a very good reputation in most places, so it's a good line on one's resume, and contacting people with a foundation email address helps a lot in getting responses.","Ultimately it's Bill and Melinda who make the decisions. They are very involved in the work of the foundation, and _a lot_ of effort goes into preparing for presenting work to them, and it can be quite a political place. There's also an annual strategy review for most teams, so a lot of energy goes into preparing for that every year. The culture is very different from team to team. Some are amazing and collegial; others are absolutely poisonous, so ask around and have 1:1 conversations with people there before joining a team."
Great Work for a Great Cause,2022-11-11,"Associate in New York, NY",4,,access to leading research and knowledge base on the most pressing global issues,Politics can be challenging to navigate

"Hard work, with amazing people and benefits",2022-09-23,"Senior Program Assistant in Seattle, WA",4,,"- brilliant and dedicated colleagues - amazing benefits, including healthcare for my family and hefty retirement account contributions - fulfilling work -- with an inspiring mission","- high expectations, sometimes feels impossible - deadline driven and can be a high stress environment - frustrating bureaucracy that can slow down productivity - top heavy org structure, often lacking support roles"
Passionate and smart people; HR is a bit of a mess,2022-09-14,"Senior Officer, Strategy Planning in Seattle, WA",4,,"You will love what you work on, have so much purpose and passion for your work. The people around you are brilliant and super respectful, nice and awesome.",HR is a mess. Policies don't make any sense and they are slow. It's not great. In addition for business minded people career progression is a bit stunted
Great mission,2022-09-22,"Senior Assistant in Seattle, WA",5,,People care about the mission Excellent benefits Competitive pay Lots of resources to lean on Smart people- can make good connections Good leadership (executive leadership team),Lots of internal politics. Some teams are toxic and chaotic like any company. Challenging for admin staff to build their career in an upward trajectory.
Fine,2022-08-25,"Program Officer in Seattle, WA",4,,"Competitive pay, strong expertise among colleagues, impactful work, office perks like snacks and catered meals and swanky events","Norms of white dominance culture, sense of urgency, de-prioritization of equity across leadership"
Dysfunctional and Hypocritical,2021-08-03,"Senior Director in Seattle, WA",2,,"Beautiful buildings, great benefits, Mission you can get behind, Lots of Fun Events and Speakers Pre-Covid","Toxic Culture, wasteful spending, ineffective leadership, not as diverse as they like to tell the public they are, little career mobility.

Fantastic,2021-10-17,"Senior Program Officer in Seattle, WA",5,,"From the top leadership all the way through to program teams and business partners, the staff are fully committed to the foundation’s mission and values. It is a place to think big and think innovatively about the world’s most pressing challenges, while partnering with the most impactful and exciting local, national and global organizations. The internal environment is highly supportive, with strong, highly conscientious, emphasis on refining culture, values and the working environment. Finally, the benefits are second to none.","While strategy helps structure and articulate grant portfolios , it can constitute a significant - sometimes excessive - part of the work for all program teams, which otherwise could be devoted to grant design, local partnership building or other country-level work. Work life balance can be challenging to achieve based on the role, depending on if the team is sufficiently staffed, but can be developed with the manager."
"Amazing institution, good perks, too many re-orgs",2022-05-29,"Senior Program Officer in Seattle, WA",4,,Great institution doing amazing work. Smart and dedicated staff. Generous benefits.,There is nearly constant re-organizing that means the job you signed up to do may change drastically or disappear. Higher level staff seem blind to the costs of this churn.
Great place to work,2022-07-13,"Associate Strategy Officer in Seattle, WA",4,,Excellent benefits and impact on the job,Promotions based on tenure rather than performance
Feedback,2022-07-22,"Program Assistant in Seattle, WA",3,,Great benefits Fast-paced Great Connections,No growth opportunities for junior and support staff. Team cultures vary significantly
Good place,2022-07-09,"Senior Program Coordinator in Seattle, WA",4,,Benefits are great. Work life balance is ok.,Pay isn’t always equitable or transparent.
"Power, Potential, Politics & Hubris",2021-11-27,"Deputy Director in Seattle, WA",3,,"Powerful mission Ability to fund good work that matters, if you are on a team empowered to execute. Good benefits and supports - including during the pandemic. When you have the right leadership and manager you truly feel like you can make a difference in the world. Resources, and the doors they open.",Limited technical expertise or focus on impact in some teams. Constant strategy refresh and overall inward focus impedes long term impact.  Staff seen and treated as disposable = lack of psychological safety on many teams. Little change / impact on diversity and inclusion; no sense of belonging in many teams. Poor track record on immigration support to staff.
It’s Complicated,2022-06-11,"Program Officer in Washington, DC",3,,Great benefits and ability to partner with incredible communities,A bit bureaucratic and risk averse; demanding hours and expectations
Fantastic job,2022-03-28,"Program Assistant II in Seattle, WA",5,,"People are passionate, kind and engaging",Sometimes high level education means more than experience

Just Know What You’re Getting Into...,2021-03-07,"Deputy Director in Seattle, WA",3,,"The Foundation is hands down the definition of generosity. The pay, benefits and perks are like no other. This review is not about the company and their generosity, it’s about the culture. When you get your shiny, impressive job offer, just know what you’re getting into. My rating is an average. 5 stars for the spirit of generosity, pay and working with fantastic people. 1 star for culture. To be fair, my rating fell in the middle at 3.","-First, the most brilliant minds in the world work here. It also means there is very little forward movement. We spend months talking and toiling about “strategy” and making everything more complicated than it needs to be. The partners in the field are doing the tough work. We are investing the money. It should not be that complicated - but the Gates culture is hooked on complicated.   -Second , lack of diversity and unconscious adherence to white supremacy culture where cutthroat behavior is normalized. Employees who are actually from the places we are supposed to be supporting are marginalized and/or pushed out.

It’s actually quite shocking for a place that claims “All Lives Have Equal Value.”   -Third, the HR department is a disaster. HR gets a bad rap in most organizations and it’s not always fair. However, at the Foundation it’s the worst I’ve ever experienced. There are way too many of them (like 70 HR people). The left has no idea what the right is doing, you ask a question and you get four different answers, and the turnover is ridiculous. Ive been a people leader for 4 years and had over a dozen HR people come and go. You can barely get a question about basic benefits answered. Don’t get me started on the recruiting process and philosophy on pay equity.   -Fourth, your team will go through change every 6 months so just expect it and plan for it. I understand change is inevitable, but it’s almost a disease at the foundation.

experience,2022-01-31,"Auditor in Los Angeles, CA",4,,nice work environment nice people,could get tired when sometimes
Great Environment with limited growth,2021-10-20,"Program Assistant in Seattle, WA",4,,Great environment and great benefits. There is generally a sense of urgency to solve GH problems. You are constantly surrounded by subject matter experts.,Limited growth especially if you are trying to switch from one job family to the other. i.e. Program Assistant to Program Coordinator. Every team is different.
"Good work life balance, excellent benefits and coworkers",2021-11-17,"Program Assistant in Seattle, WA",5,,"work life balance, organized and talented co-workers, team oriented, top notch benefits",not many opportunities for growth
"Great people, Great work",2021-02-01,"Software Test Engineer in Seattle, WA",5,,"The people at this company are some of the smartest and most dedicated I've ever met. Everyone truly believes in the value of what they are doing and this sense of duty is present in daily work and interactions. Benefits are amazing, pay is good, and ability to go to sleep at night has gone up remarkably with the start of this job.","People work a lot. People work so hard and so often that the company has ""quiet weeks"" which ensure that people can't do meetings and are forced to focus on work and take it easy. Management definitely tries to get people to work less but if your work is ""saving the world"" it becomes harder and harder to justify taking time off. That said, much effort is made to ensure that employees have a good work life balance."

Diet,2021-11-11,"Dietary Aide in North Chicago, IL",5,,It is a great place to work,It’s very far away from my home
Middle Management Rules the Day,2021-03-01,"Senior Program Officer in Seattle, WA",3,,- Great benefits - CEO who seems to genuinely care and wants to work on known cultural problems - Beautiful campus - Connection to a larger mission,"- Your experience is highly manager-dependent and while many are good, some are appallingly bad with little to no consequence. - Performance, credentials, and expertise are valued over interpersonal skills and trust building, allowing some individuals to get away with abusive behavior without consequence. - Total lack of diversity and unconscious adherence to white supremacy culture where cutthroat behavior is normalized and employees who are actually from the places we work are marginalized and/or pushed out and where grant dollars go to white-led institutions, especially in research. - Smart young people are hired and then marginalized with little opportunity for upward mobility. Generally, BMGF is the place to finish your career, not get it started (although there are a few exceptions). Programmatic roles are generally occupied by people who skew toward retirement age.  - Generous benefits for parents on paper, but systemic discrimination of women with caregiving responsibilities in practice. This has showed up in major ways during COVID, where expectation have remained astronomically high and women are starting to leave. I know of several instances of women being denied opportunities or pushed out because of their caregiving responsibilities during COVID. - Major disconnect between our ""talk"" (i.e. what Bill and Melinda write and speak about) and our ""walk"" (i.e. how we do our work and how employees are treated internally)."

Inspiring place to work,2018-07-20,"Program Officer in Seattle, WA",5,,"I'm constantly inspired by the work supported by BMGF, which impacts some of the biggest problems in global health. As a private foundation, they can take controversial stances and innovate in ways you often don't see elsewhere in development. I feel lucky to contribute.  Employees are treated very well. The benefits are amazing","There are the usual office politics, and a lot of credit-seeking driven by individual egos, but I think that is pretty normal in an organization, especially one trying to attract 'the best'.   Employees are treated very well, sometimes too well (e.g. business class flights), which is uncomfortable when thinking about the geographies we serve and how that money could be better spent."

"It isn't perfect, but what place is?",2011-03-10,"Operations - Program Assistant in Seattle, WA",4,,"Generous benefits (insurance, matching for retirement, up to date technology items, free snacks/sodas, etc.), generally an overall positive team environment, individuals who are focused not only on their own professional improvements, but also overall team improvements.  As the foundation grows in size, there are gradual improvements to process which yes take time to implement, but are done so with careful consideration (albeit sometimes over democratic rationale) of input.  I am a 4+ year veteran of the foundation and I still love coming to work 95% of the time.","At times can be difficult to communicate effectively with other teams. What I don't understand are some of the budgeting decisions made as this organization operates under the idea that there is a limitation to funds yet the co-chairs spend literally crazy amounts of funds to build a new campus.  There are still general feelings of unfairness between programs and operations units - the program areas definitely get preferential treatment. Programs and operations are held to differing standards of ROI, expenditures, employee performance and behaviors. More could be done from the foundation's leadership team to finally once and for all truly try to change perspectives and behaviors between the programs and operations.  There are still pockets of individuals who choose to push their hierarchy/title upon others."

So much that's good with a couple of fatal flaw,2018-09-25,"Program Officer in Seattle, WA",3,,"-Inspiring mission with ability to connect your work every day to that mission -Opportunity to do interesting and novel work constantly; if you are willing to lean in to it, you can find tons of ways to add value -Amazing benefits - frankly, I can't imagine finding better ones anywhere -Smart and motivated colleagues -Decent work/life balance (somewhat depends on your team but if you're willing to set personal boundaries, people generally respect them) -Senior leadership's priorities are in the right place","-No clear or logical pathways for promotion -Job title in the program officer family can feel arbitrarily assigned -Visible voices and charisma are valued over quality of work execution; translates into a culture where men are systematically valued over women -You need a manager who values your work and advocates for you to move ahead; if you don't have that, you are out of luck -They over-hire and hire often without a clear idea of what folks will do when they get there -Senior leadership priorities don't always get translated to action that makes sense"
"Great place to work, but not a place where everyone will thrive",2018-06-06,"Program Officer in Seattle, WA",4,,"1. Opportunity to play a part in addressing some of the biggest, most important challenges of our time 2. You'll get professional opportunities here you won't get anywhere else (e.g. who you get to work with, events you get to participate in, speakers that come to the foundation) 3. Unparalleled benefits 4. Beautiful workspace 5. Very flexible working schedule","You're experience will vary widely team-by-team, but basically:  1. The foundation has yet to create a culture and work environment where people of different backgrounds can thrive. Right now, it favors workaholic types with American communication styles (e.g. speaking in bullets, very direct) 2. Pretty much constant change--the decision-making process for which is not always transparent or fair. 3. While the CEO and executive leadership team are trying to address this, managers are generally pretty weak. Don't expect a lot of time or support in terms of mentorship or support to grow your career. 4. Because there are few open positions, it can be hard to ""move up""--especially from PO to SPO and SPO to DD."
"Great mission, rewarding work but unhealthy culture of backstabbing, disrespect and lack of leadership.",2012-08-07,"Anonymous Employee in Seattle, WA",3,,"If you want to work with some of the brightest people, use the latest technology and feel like you're making a difference then this is an amazing place to work. The campus is beautiful and the benefits are exceptional. Great place for people who are self starters, who know what to do and just do it. The operations areas are among the more people-friendly areas in which to work. There is a great deal of opportunity here.","Unfortunately this is a very challenging environment. The executive management team doesn't seem to have a clue as to what the ""worker bees"" need to get their jobs done. Their answer is process and more process. Just when you think there can't possibly be another set of templates, another committee, another whole department with some long acronym designed to help you get stuff done... And, at the end of the day, you are just a cog in the machine. They know the work will chew you up in 2 or 3 years tops. And they don't care because there is an endless parade of wide eyed people eager to have a chance to work there. Many managers have no idea how to manage people. Don't bother complaining to HR though. HR is the department of platitudes."
Nothing good comes easy.,2019-12-15,"Senior Program Coordinator in Seattle, WA",4,,"At BMGF I worked with some of the most remarkable colleagues - not just intelligent and accomplished, but truly kind and caring folks with unique backgrounds and life experiences to contribute. Benefits are outstanding. Wonderful, consistent learning opportunities and depending on your team, chances to stretch and gain new skills with exciting projects.","Nothing dominates an organizational culture more than how it defines success. At BMGF, success is working as diligently as possible, as often as possible, and being the smartest person in the room (or at least in your subject area). Its borderline obsessed with how ""complicated"" and ""difficult"" its work is, and it sometimes seems like you earn more points for taking apart a problem analytically, than actually figuring out how to have tangible impact The result is a very curious, learning-oriented, but ultimately inward-facing organization that's more afraid to fail than its willing to admit. If you're already working in development, this won't be news to you. But any person should know what you're getting into, and how you want to navigate it - work/life balance will be 100% up to you."

Representing the foundation you get to be a part of many high-level conversations at the global level and benefit from working with partners who are at the forefront of the field in both research and implementation.","The work environment is very politically charged and it is easy to get bogged down in internal churn. I don't know if it is typical for this size of an organization, but the number of reorgs seems unnecessary and a huge barrier for getting work done. It's also tough for morale when smart and effective people are getting laid off and people who are good at upward politics but seem to care less about the actual work are recognized and promoted."
Ok,2020-10-30,"Analyst in Chicago, IL",5,,"Impact, Friends, Bill, Impact, Impact",Everything is too slow. OK
Prepare for bureaucracy if you work here.,2015-06-21,"Senior Analyst in Seattle, WA",3,,Benefits package is outstanding. Some genuinely nice people. The belief that what you are doing is truly helping to save the world. Beautiful offices and landscaping. Onsite fitness gym and food (food is not free).,"Continual hiring of individuals only for their field/specialty talent results in individuals in key roles who have no experience or interest with people management, career development, technology, or communication skills beyond the grantees.  The framework (of how teams report upwards) and executive leadership continues to operate in a clunky old-boys club fashion. Considering how dismal morale is across the entire company, I and many others believe that change is currently underway; however, the change is being done in such a mean, rapid, and secretive state that many current employees such as myself are meant to feel like pawns.  The family feeling that once existed as vanished and there is no hope of it coming back. Bill and Melinda have not been present."
"Great mission, great people, great benefits",2020-08-26,"Senior Program Officer Global Policy & Advocacy in Seattle, WA",5,,"Excellent benefits, fair compensation, and the mission is at the core of the work.","Evolving DEI approach, little mobility internally."
Amazing professional experience,2020-08-15,"Summer Intern in Washington, DC",4,,Intern program is extremely well structured to introduce interns to Foundation leadership and the breadth of organizational functions. Competitive pay and excellent professional development opportunities.,The intern program is not designed to culminate in a potential job offer.

inspiring opportunity with smart colleagues,2020-10-08,"Associate Strategy Officer in Seattle, WA",5,,smart colleagues and mission driven,no clear career progression opportunity
The Hunger Games lived daily.,2016-02-09,"Business Analyst in Seattle, WA",1,,Mission & benefits but not worth abuse from colleagues and managers.,"Management is incompetent; crippled by bureaucracy. They can't make a decision without hiring at least two consulting firms tell them what they should do. The consulting firms have this figured out and take advantage at every turn, but management can't see it. Fear of technology and change is a core competency at the foundation. Stay away from IT if you like working with the latest and greatest technology. Change management and holding the users hand are the most critical elements of a project. If you don't like writing job aids for bone headed talks, the foundation is not for you. The foundation has implemented the stack ranking review process Microsoft abandoned two years ago. It was very interesting to see how it plays out in a female dominated workplace. It is much more brutal than at Microsoft. Lies about my character, that my boss knew was false ended up in my review. I've seen four people in four years get fired by my boss or direct reports because they don't like them. The environment reminds me of the sorority I quit in college. There is no teamwork."
Nowhere else like here,2017-09-13,"Director in Seattle, WA",5,,"Today I had an amazing lunch conversation at Gates with a colleague talking about how one of our grants is enabling the largest mapping of social networks ever attempted - across nearly 800 villages in Honduras - to accelerate the speed and adoption of transformative health outcomes. I looked up and realized similar inspiring and innovative conversations were happening all around me. Smart, creative, passionate, committed colleagues, all leaning in to changing the world at scale. Yes, there are challenging days yet that's often the case when trying to do big things that matter. It's a real privilege to be here.","Under Sue (CEO), the foundation is making huge strides forward in everything from culture to management and from simplification to fun. Yet, there are still managers and leaders here not fully on the bus, so the place can feel uneven. Best to understand the nature and dynamics of the team you are joining beforehand."
Company Review,2020-09-29,"Program Assistant in Seattle, WA",5,,"Amazing passion and determination in colleagues, great benefits",Lack of work life balance
Senior Program Officer,2018-11-15,"Anonymous Employee in Seattle, WA",3,,Bill and Melinda are tackling some of the toughest problems in the world. They do not give up on challenging issues. Employees are mission driven and care about the work they do. Lots of smart people to work with. Great benefits- full year off for paternity/maternity with pay.,"US Program senior leadership jumps when Bill raises an eyebrow. There is constant change on the tools used to get the job done. Silly issues like open space and where people sit dominate office politics. Motto is ""overthinking analysis"" which leads to public paralysis. Most of the work is feeding the machine."
Good place to work but not the best place to work.,2014-12-12,"Anonymous Employee in Seattle, WA",2,,"Best benefit package. Great retirement benefits.  Some awesome pool of smart super intelligent people.  People from diverse background understand and follow the mission. Great campus. Get to meet with Bill & Melinda, Mr. Bill Sr., and also Warren Buffet.","Not the best place to work. Hurts to see that many people don't even follow the mission. Apparently 'All lives have equal value', is not practiced by each manager. Amazing to see that your title speaks so much about the behavior and treatment from high level people, especially in your own team. You will be the luckiest if you end up in a team that has a great manager.   No growth opportunities. If u apply for other roles within the organization, you become the most unfavorable person on the team.   A lot of perception which is highly biased and doesn't work in your favor. If they don't want you they will find a reason you ensure you are gone. Double standards are hurtful to see. Hoping that with the new CEO, things will change for better."
Assistant,2016-03-30,"Assistant in Seattle, WA",2,,"The benefits cannot be overstated, they are unbelievably generous. The mission and resources available to ""drive toward impact"" (a very gatesian term) is noble and lofty. You may also get to work with some of the smartest, humblest, and nicest people in the world and learn so much.","It is more likely that you will work alongside people who are just trying to do their job and stay under the radar. Too many reorgs, too many bad managers, and too much political lobbying for too few promotions from within the organization. Program staff can only get so far and then they just get more work and more responsibility dumped on them and support staff have nowhere to go. When opportunities do arise, it is always a cattle call and survival of the fittest. The most politically well-connected win the day. Skill, experience, competency, commitment don't always mean anything."
Potential to be a truly premier employer,2017-07-19,"Director in Seattle, WA",4,,High caliber staff; mission-driven organization that is having global impact; challenging work that provides career development opportunities; exceptional benefits; very competitive base pay for most roles; workplace amenities.,"High workload and ineffective prioritization by leadership and managers creates employee burnout/frustration and failure to focus on highest priorities (org wide challenge); ongoing turnover of execs on operations side; inability to figure out business and resourcing model for global strategies; ongoing strategy changes/new directions require employees to be highly change agile and comfortable dealing with ambiguity, reorgs, new managers, etc.; terrible commute for Seattle employees due to Mercer/S. Lake Union congestion"
Constant Growth and Learning Opportunities,2012-02-22,"in Seattle, WA",5,,"* The mission and values of the company can't be beat * All health care covered, including domestic partners * Money Share Account in which 15% of your annual pay is automatically contributed by the foundation * They match your personal donations to charitable organizations by 3xs * Many opportunities for promotion if you are a self-starter and proactive * Lots of parents with young kids work here * Wonderful office/campus (across the street from the Seattle Center) *Great commuter benefits","*If you aren't liberal or progressive, this is NOT the place for you * Ethnic diversity is low, despite the work we do. Therefore you can feel like a ""colonizer"" at times. Most of the senior leadership at this (global organization) is white and male- and from South Africa at that. (They just replaced their Asian president of Global Health, and their female president of Global Development with white men- go figure.  * Passive-aggressive, but this also reflects the PNW/Seattle area * Lots of Type A people, and many who don't have a lot of personality * They often overhire, i.e., many of the program assistants (admin assist.) have two degrees."
"good foundation, great mission, questionable internal politics",2014-04-02,"IT Engineer in Seattle, WA",4,,"Great mission, loved the fact that you felt your work everyday impacted others who are less fortunate. The benefits, even as a contractor are great, snacks / drinks on site, wonderful location, right next to the space needle. Great compensation for my position, I have heard this is similar throughout the organization, at lots of levels. On-site cafeteria is amazing, probably on par with Microsoft campus, if not better.","Bizarre internal politics, team A will let team B fail just so they can claim 'they told you so', things I've never seen in corporate america or anywhere really. A lot of times as a contractor you will be dangled a carrot (of a full time position) that will never materialize (minor critique)."
Competitive Environment with very Smart Co-Workers,2013-09-22,"Program Coordinator in Seattle, WA",4,,"Everyone can agree that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation does world changing work. I have worked there in two different capacities two different times in the last 9 years and the culture of highly competitive, extremely intelligent people remain. The company still operates as a young organization in that it embraces new ideas and it's always evolving. People who dislike change would not be happy here. The benefits can't be beat and the environment is stunning in the new campus. They encourage working from home and remote work, which is helpful in the sometimes intense and stressful office environment.","This is a company of academics, there is not a lot of silliness or fun happening at this organization, which makes sense due to the importance of their mission. There is a competitive feeling throughout the company that can feel oppressive, but they still embrance a sense of creativity and change. They constantly re-org often with little to no notice or reasoning behind the changes which is pretty jarring, so you have to be someone who can embrance change easily to thrive in this environment."
Culture is intense. Mission is inspirational. Benefits are awesome!,2014-04-17,"Business Analyst in Seattle, WA",5,,"- You will never lose your job because of the economy - You will be around the most passionate, intelligent, and dedicated people on the planet - The benefits are incredible especially if you have a family","- You will likely lose your job because of burnout or a random reorganization - Consultants will probably get the roles you want. If you're working in supporting the mission outside of the grant-making process (such as in IT, Finance, HR etc), you will feel a little left out from the grantee-facing work - Culture is highly political and heroic efforts are expected. Sometimes, you will wonder whether better planning could have prevented the heroic efforts"
Where smart people go to feel stupid...,2015-11-22,"Senior Program Officer in Seattle, WA",3,,"Amazing bright colleagues, inspiring mission, great benefits, most people in the country will return your calls.  Great learning opportunities.","They hire some of the best and the brightest, but then give them little power to act on it. Unrealistic faith that great strategic planning and technology alone can change the world Too much value placed on to ""manage up"" -- especially to Bill (that guy in the corner office)"
A fast-paced place to learn tremendously but you have to like being under constant stress,2012-12-02,"Program Assistant in Seattle, WA",4,,"If you like being around smart interesting people with amazing backgrounds and ambitions, BMGF is great. You learn a lot and if you have a great manager, can grow.   Lots of resources for creativity.","Generally a stressful and competitive place. HR and management is poor-- not a lot of transparency, accountability and feedback loops, poor consistency and standards, lots of people without management experience doing management. Lots of smart people means lots of ego to deal with. The organization is constantly reorganizing and this is also stressful. Top and bottom heavy organization with little clear upward mobility within the organization."
"Bad culture and employees are used, burnt out and discarded.",2017-10-26,"Senior Program Officer in Seattle, WA",1,,"The BMGF is a place where you can make a difference, but see below for the downsides. Working for the BMGF is very interesting and can be rewarding, but you need to celebrate internally because no one ever says 'thank you' or 'good job'.","Terrible work environment and culture. The pace and the demands of the job eventually wear you down mentally and physically and many employees end up needing mental health care. Everyone who works on a scientific or technical team is eventually forced out of the organization by their manager or management, usually in a horrible undignified way. Employees are used by the organization until they are burned out and then they are cast adrift. The co-chairs when asked will admit that they aren't looking for long term employees. What matters most to the BMGF is the Gates' family brand."
Great opportunities for hard working individuals,2016-01-24,"Senior Program Assistant in Seattle, WA",5,,"The mission of the foundation is one that makes you proud to come to work every day. That coupled with an amazing facility to work in and smart, caring coworkers, make it a great place to work.",Opportunities for advancement are far and few between. It isn't impossible but it not only takes hard work but you need the good fortune of a manager who cares about your career. Not everyone finds themselves in this fortunate situation.
"The foundation is an excellent place to work: amazing co-workers, great benefits, gratifying work.",2011-08-10,"Program Coordinator in Seattle, WA",5,,"The staff includes some of the brightest, most focused, most empathetic people I've ever worked with. The gold-plated benefits package includes amazing health insurance, 3 weeks paid vacation (which you're encouraged to take) + 2 weeks sick + holidays, 3 months full paid maternity leave. There are some international travel opportunities, depending on which section you work in and your role. The work is generally fascinating. Everyone is very proud of the mission.","It is difficult to move upwards in the organization - positions such as Program Officers and Senior Program Officers generally require many years of work experience. There is no natural career progression within the foundation. The foundation is still growing rapidly as an organization, and thus many of its internal processes and systems haven't kept up well with its growth -- meaning there are often IT and communications frustrations, and a seeming lack of internal structure. Some managers have little-to-no experience or training in managing employees."

Fifedom's abound.  Senior managers lack good management skills and have no accountability for their own organizational health  Very little visability with executives/leaders - senior managers control all the information flow.  Incredibly bureaucratic for an organization of this size - Microsoft has a more nimble bureacracy than BMGF  Many unhappy people inside who live in fear because they have few career options in Seattle with the same prestige, so they are forced to stay there   Abstracted from the real work on the ground and depend too much on consultants who make $200+ per hour to inform their decision making.

Most incredible workplace in this world!,2018-02-18,"Finance Leader in Seattle, WA",5,,"When I joined the foundation ~ 2 years ago, I hardly understood the impact it would have on my life, both personally and professionally. I have never met a more passionate, kind and humble group of people. I feel privileged and honored to have stood by your side and call you my colleague. Even though my time there was short - I wouldn't trade it for the world! This is one of the best jobs in this world and we are so blessed to be able to be part of this mission.   Pros include:  1. Surrounded by some of the most talented and caring people on this planet.  2. Great work life balance with competitive salary and benefits. The benefits are almost too good.  3. Opportunity to work on the the toughest problems in this world.  4. Incredibly humbling to work for Bill and Melinda Gates. They are a huge inspiration to this world.  5. Making this world a better place for many generations to come.  6. CEO, Sue is very inspiring and doing a great job at running the org.","Overall, the foundation is a phenomenal place. Here are some areas for development.  1. I really wish there were company wide OKRs to be shared x-foundation. The teams / departments felt siloed.  2. Program ELT are very ""formal"" and it was difficult to connect with them as people. I felt like I needed a PHD in every subject on this planet from an Ivy League institution to even understand them during Org wide All Hands.  3. Instill pay for performance to motivate teams to work better together.  4. Over collaboration: When working on programs / projects, the foundation tends to over collaborate and ensures that feedback from every person and use case is taken into consideration. This makes it difficult to launch systems, processes, etc."

The place can sometimes feel like something out of Kafka or Heller.  -It's also true that it can be a very cut-throat place, but that varied by team, manager, and director.  -And it's also true about the perpetually shifting sands, continual reorgs, and endless Powerpoints. I think one reason for this is the unrealistic goal-setting, at least in some program areas. Departments often set themselves up for failure by setting goals that are nearly impossible and whose achievement they have no control over.  -Permanent sense of inadequacy: Despite year after year of positive reviews and 360s there was always a nagging sense of inadequacy. (As one colleague, a Stanford PhD, once put it, ""I've never worked anywhere where I felt so dumb."") I felt bad about myself all the time, even when I was winning awards for service. -There is a lot of churn, and very little chance for advancement. But it should be noted that the organization is very up-front about this. They make it clear: No career ladder. And while there are no formal ""term limits"" for program staff, there's an expectation that you'll cycle back into your field after 3-5 years. -All the policies and tools that enable you to work anytime, anywhere--which is great for flexibility--can, along with all the pressure, make work-life balance difficult.

Arrogant self-promoters and middle management with no values is the norm here. There is a belief in ""rock star"" syndrome which deters collaboration and stifles ""growth mindset.""

But that's the minority. -Really top-heavy structure that focuses on bringing in top talent at the top but does not work to grow their people from within.  -Many technical experts put into management positions that are not in their skill set.  -Tendency to gloss over the root causes of staff dissatisfaction by having more ""team-building"" and parties, but not fixing fundamental flaws. -Program assistant and contract staff are often treated wretchedly. We hire all these bright, enthusiastic kids in their early 20s with MAs already who think being a PA is a foot in the door here, but it isn't, and then they are so unhappy in assistant roles."
There are much better places to dedicate your time and talents to!,2018-02-01,"Senior Program Officer in Seattle, WA",2,,"Flexibility, good work/life balance (besides the travel, but that comes with the industry), generous benefits, and the chance to work with some fantastic grantees and partners.","Disfunction comes from the very top, and creates a lot of fear, toxicity, inefficiencies, and wasted resources. Although large in staff size and endowment, Gates is a family foundation with active benefactors and has never (successfully) reckoned with the fact that family values, perspectives, and ways of engaging with staff might be fundamentally at odds with the ""data-driven, impact-oriented, feminist (ha!)"" institution that BMGF spins itself as. The generosity of the Gates Family is (obviously) worthy of celebration and respect, but they often treat their staff with disrespect and create a culture where fear of being wrong (or, gasp, just acknowledging we don't have all the answers) gets in the way of any genuine learning, sharing, and progress.   There is also a culture of constant complaining and negativity that gets old immediately. The lack of humility (and, to be frank, connection to reality) is truly astounding; it's an institution and culture that celebrates and seems to incentivize grandstanding amongst all levels of staff.   I had a decent boss, autonomy with my work, and loved making grants, but the culture and leadership was uninspiring on the best days and painful the rest of the time. I've worked at a variety of academic, public, and private institutions over the past several decades and have never had a workplace where people crying (yes, crying) was a regular occurrence. Leaving felt incredibly freeing, and I have been much, much happier at another global health institution."
It's better than you've heard,2013-11-25,"Associate Program Officer in Seattle, WA",4,,"Working at the Gates Foundation provides an opportunity to be on the leading edge of work in your field with very smart colleagues, generous salary / benefits, and immense resources. People are, by and large, there because they're passionate about what they're doing. The Foundation is working very consciously to improve both their external and internal reputation. The connections you make while working there will take your career in amazing directions.","Seattle culture infiltrates the Foundation. There's a lot of talking and there can be annoying turf issues. Expensive outside consultants are used too often and consultant-speak unintelligible to normal humans is ubiquitous (e.g. ""boil the ocean"", ""surface learnings"", ""convening""). It is a family foundation, too, which means that an extraordinary amount of energy and time are devoted to getting and keeping the ""co-chairs"" engaged in your work. If they don't get or agree with the direction of where you're going, it doesn't happen. There is a definite bias toward technology solutions, even where they aren't appropriate. And it is easily the most narcissistic place I have ever worked. ""Tell us more about us! Tell us how bad we are! We want your open and honest feedback!"" My biggest frustration is the lack of internal mentors or conscious career development. That and ""the matrix""-- which alludes to the number of people you need to involve in anything you do. It's been humbling. Know that it is not a ""dream job"".   The best way to get there is to be great at what you do in your field. I ignore anyone who hits me up on LinkedIn because they've ""always wanted to work at the Foundation!"". That starts happening a lot once you begin working there."
"Strong mission, hard culture",2017-10-13,"Program Officer in Seattle, WA",2,,"Smart colleagues, mission, pay, benefits, physical space, impact on the world. Some marginal improvements in the culture. CEO ethical and has good ideas. Bill and Melinda are inspiring and the work is really important.","I’ve been at the foundation for 10 years and the lack of collaboration at exec level remains a challenge. Lot of good talk about culture but everyone knows that senior execs throw each other under the bus and go to Bill to get funding. Loss of top operations leaders (COO earlier, CFO leaving soon), who modeled the right collaborative behavior and culture attributes, has been disheartening. Commute to/from east side getting worse and worse."

The people who work there are passionate for what they do and believe in the mission.","The issues that are worked on are so important that work life balance can be a struggle. When a person knows that their work might impact people's lives they tend to put more time and effort into it, meaning home life can suffer."
Real commitment to culture change.,2016-07-01,"Operations Manager in Seattle, WA",4,,"An amazing mission, many wonderful caring people, challenging global problems, and incredible resources make for a stimulating and dynamic environment.","There's a serious effort underway to improve the culture, and unlock the true potential of this place.

Deputy Director,2015-12-23,"Deputy Director in Seattle, WA",4,,You get to work with extremely smart and impressive colleagues.

Great mission; poor culture,2017-01-19,"Senior Program Officer in Seattle, WA",2,,"Work on large-scale, transformative solutions to gnarly global challenges. There is no other place that does this kind of work at this scale. People are very smart (& they know it!).","The culture is very bad and management is very slow to implement change. A recent employee survey quoted the culture as one of ""sharks and vultures."" There is also an unspoken hubris centered around the 'white savior' complex that manifests itself in the outsized influence we have in the global development space. This is due, in part, to the lack of diversity in hiring both ethnically and academically. It is not a humble organization and it does not hire a lot of humble people b/c the outspoken, self-promoters are rewarded and thus, that behavior is reinforced. I have seen my colleagues plagiarize the work of our grantees, take credit for work they did not do (through benign 'lack of acknowledgement'), relentlessly self-promote, and hide failures in order to protect their reputations - all so, they can be visible. Additionally, there are few opportunities to get promoted despite the plethora of jobs. In one instance, I heard a manager say that ""we hire for a job; not a career.""  Even many long term staff admit that the only reason they stay is b/c of the ""golden handcuffs."" The salary and benefits are so generous that it makes it hard to leave, especially in Seattle where there are few other options where you can go to do mission-oriented work and still make a corporate salary."
The awesome benefits in no way justify the lack of leadership and general decency for many are treated.,2012-03-31,"in Seattle, WA",2,,The benefits package is great and comprehensive. New campus is beautiful and gives an appearance of transparency. Location near Space Needle is a bonus.,"No understanding of the difference between leadership and managing/supervising. Non liberal/democrats will be shunned -- in the most passive/agressive manner possible, as this is predominant personality trait at foundation. High-school cliques, bad-behavior, gossip and mis-information determine one's perceived value, as senior-most managers take and any bits of information to churn out what they later call ""performance reveiws"".  HR exists to protect upper management, period. No ability for this entity to assess, resolve, mentor, guide or direct employees that don't see eye to eye to resolution."
Stressful Environment,2015-11-19,"Program Assistant in Seattle, WA",3,,Benefits are amazing and you are exposed to ground breaking and important ideas and leaders. The people that work there are very mindful and caring in their pursuit to solve some of the world's biggest problems.,Very stressful environment. They suck the life out of you. There is no work-life balance even though they try to convince you there is. The upper management is not in touch with what the real work involves. They take imprudent shortcuts to look like they are saving money. There is a definite imbalance between the intellectual/academic knowledge and good business practices. They hire for a very specific bit of expertise and then there is verylittle mobility within the organization -- especially at the lower levels.
Still maturing as an organization - Positive experiences far outweigh the growing pains,2011-05-19,"Information Technology Professional in Seattle, WA",4,,"- The mission of the foundation helps you get through the tough times, and lifts you up through the good times - Without question, You work with the best and the brightest in any respective field, at all levels of the organization. - The foundation's clients (grantees) are some of the best and brightest as well, and are highly passionate about the work that they do - Operates more like a corporation than a grass-roots 501c3 (can be good and bad) - Good information sharing from executive management. More face-to-face time with execs than your typical medium sized organization. - Excellent suite of benefits - Excellent physical work space with a strong emphasis on the employee, alternative working styles, etc  Counterpoints: - An appropriate amount of growth/management opportunities availible to those up to the task. One can't complain about having inexperienced managers as well as having no growth opportunities. The inexperienced managers are in place because they were given the opportunity to manage. - The foundation is highly diverse, particuarly within Global Development, Global Health, and IT. You will work with individuals from all over the word, with rich experiences from a multitude of organizations and cultures.",- Consensus driven conservative decision making. As a result it is difficult and generally more difficult costly to acomplish tasks and projects compared to other non-profit/for-profit organizations - High number of IT consultants/contractors can make knowledge retention and consistent strategies/methodologies a challenge (noticiable full-time hiring ramp up within the last 6 months though) - Operates more like a corporation than a grass-roots 501c3 (can be good and bad) - Limited process consistency across the various grant-distributing facets of the organization that should run in a similar manner. This makes IT solutioning difficult.
Rode hard and...yeah...,2016-05-15,"Project Coordinator in Seattle, WA",1,,"The mIddle- and low-level employees that actually get the day-to-day work done are amazing individuals. Some of the smartest, most compassionate people I've ever met. Great benefits package (5 stars). Salaries are good for those coming from the non-profit world, but no where near where they need to be for the level of work that's being done (1 star).","Leadership is not interested in employee development whatsoever. They say that each person has a budget allowance for it each year, but in 8 years, none of my requests were ever approved. Management is more interested in paying BIG BIG bucks to McKinsey and the like instead of developing their own talent. Good employees are used and abused and then unceremoniously let go when their positions have been ""phased out"" due to yet another reorganization."
Program Officer,2015-07-06,"Program Officer in Seattle, WA",2,,"There is no shortage of opportunities at the foundation. If you are proactive and don't get burned out (and have a decent manager) you can certainly create opportunities to grow and learn while you are there. But you will most certainly need to create them for yourself. If you come into the right role, you will have the world at your fingertips.   What is said about the benefits and compensation is true as well. It's really a first class package and above any industry standard for many of the positions here.","As an individual who had previously only worked at small organizations, this was an eye-opening experience for me. I can only imagine that it must be akin to working in a massive bureaucracy or government agency.   Everyone is on a different page here and things are constantly evolving at a rate that seems nearly impossible and certainly irresponsible. Restructurings of teams and strategy refreshes come rolling down the hill before teams are even able to get their feet under them. It's all quite MSFT-y in the culture and driven by a very, very old-fashioned, centralized, top-down management structure. Achieving any sort of actual results towards the mission within this environment is not impossible, but it certainly is the exception.   Managers are not incentivized to manage, lead, or make decisions. They are all accountable as individual contributors, so at the end of the day they are looking out for themselves. Nearly everyone who walks through the door (and I will certainly admit I am not immune to this) is on the personal quest for their own significance as it relates to the mission. This can very often override the greater good and any sense of working as a team.   The most important thing to know in all of this is that every dysfunction leads back to the founders themselves. Much of the problems are not solvable because of this fact. No one is able to have frank conversations with them. They dictate the culture at the very top and this drives everything else below. An annual results review meeting with each team is like presenting in front of a royal court. The weeks and months of churn and anxiety that lead up to these meetings are astounding and this is just one example.    Bottom line: go there for the opportunities, go there for your own career, but don't go there expecting to actually contribute to social impact."

This is why people stay at Gates Foundation despite being miserable, despite the woeful management, despite the gruesome internal politics","Only one part of the foundation is more or less functional and that's the India Country Office. To be based in Seattle is to be part of a Kafkaesque bureaucracy with House of Cards-like internal politics. No one knows who makes decisions and directors sabotage each other to win the influence of Bill & Melinda. The most bloodthirsty and politically strategic are the ones who stick around the longest. As a result, among management, you've got some good people who stick around for a year or two and the rest are bunch of Frank Underwoods who cut others down to prop themselves up. If you're able to get on a good team (say Nutrition or FSP) and stay focused on your grantmaking and external-facing work, then you might find peace. If you're sensitive or susceptible to internal politics, forget about it.  There were high hopes that Sue Desmond-Hellmann would turn the ship around. Instead, she seems more concerned with promoting her own profile than reforming bad management. She filled leadership gaps with her former colleagues from Genentech that have only maintained the status quo and her C-level hiring has been very disappointing.   Most program staff join Gates Foundation because it's such a behemoth in global development and we feel like we could make a big difference with just a few small tweaks. Sadly, we fail and we leave."

While programmatic staff are hired for their skill-set, it seems not to be trusted. Often you have to contract a consultant to regurgitate your knowledge for the Director level to accept it. Often it seems that the business side of the operation is more important than solving the Foundation mission.

The worst part was watching the effect on my grantees and the field. The leadership and management are horrible. Yelling, fist pounding and insults from management and leadership are tolerated.

Internal processes and politics are THE top priorities at the foundation,2012-03-07,"Program Officer in Seattle, WA",1,,"- Positive mission statement, was started by people who's hearts were in the right place - Huge economic stimulus to the nonprofit and NGO sectors and the agencies/firms/consultants that support them - Get to meet and network with top leaders from the political, NGO, entertainment, and science worlds  - Huge budgets: if you can dream it and marshal the political will behind it, you can do it - Generous retirement contributions - Can score a free lunch most days due to large number of lunchtime meetings - West coast office hours - everyone is gone by 5:30pm (but you will still have to work from home) - Nice new campus, they make it easy to bike to work even during the rainy months","The Bottom Line: You need to bring your political A-game if you want to survive here.   The Organization:  It's common to hear ""this place is like a startup"". It is in some ways. Unfortunately, the more positive aspects of startup culture are not represented here. In a startup people tend to rally behind the mission and all pull together to accomplish goals. Success is interdependent at a startup.   Just the opposite is true at the foundation. It's very much a zero-sum game and success is not conceived of as being mutual. Turf wars abound between teams and within teams; struggling for attention/blessing from the highest levels of foundation leadership, funding for their projects, team headcount, and media coverage. This creates a lot of enmity between people and teams, the greatest casualties are the great ideas that never come to fruition and missed opportunities. Being a team player is not on anyone's annual goals.  The organization is constantly reorganizing. This creates a lot of uncertainty for projects, issues and the people who work on them. Twelve to eighteen months between major reorganizations is about the norm, shorter for more minor reorgs. Leadership can't seem stick with one operating model long enough to thoroughly vet it before moving on to the next thing. ""Top tier"" management consulting companies have deeply embedded themselves at the foundation and attached themselves to influential leaders. These management consultants are very effective at triggering reorganizations which result in a big payday for them.    The Leadership:  The incentive is to ""manage up"" rather than manage across or down. Without a good boss/mentor/champion behind you, it's very difficult if not impossible to advance your career here. Very few people are lucky enough to find someone who wants to pull them up.  There is little to no emphasis on working together better. After an internal analysis revealed a level of dissatisfaction around the culture and how people worked together, a senior leader was asked what was being done to improve the situation. This leader indicated to the staff that those are not the metrics that leadership is focused on.    The Work:  The public perception may be that the foundation is a fulfilling place to work because of all the good it does. The reality is quite different. The foundation is essentially a checkbook and as an everyday employee you are many layers away from the work being performed on the ground by sub-sub-sub-sub-contractors. Additionally, the foundation's grantees and vendors charge what is known as ""Gates rates"". Almost every request for funding or contract is significantly inflated. It's often disheartening to see so much of the budget be eaten up by inflated expenses.  The foundation tends to work with the same set of ""partners"" who have become entrenched interests at the foundation. There's very little appetite or ability to solicit fresh new ideas from hungry, smaller partners. In the case of these large entrenched, and often highly entitled, partners, the relationships have become dysfunctional - more about the money than the good work.  Strategy refreshes for issues are frequent, intense and can take upwards of 5 months to complete. This prevents the real work from being done on the ground. Supporting these strategy refreshes is another huge stream of money for ""top tier"" management consulting firms working at the foundation.   The Coworkers:  Cautionary tale: I got thrown under the bus on my third day of employment after being invited out for a ""welcome lunch"" by one of my peers. On the fourth day our group's Business Officer chewed me out because my lunch-mate from the previous day had reported me and intentionally misrepresented what I said. You never know who you can really trust.  People from the northwest tend to be pretty frosty and passive aggressive, but the folks here take it to a whole new level. Feeling completely alone in a building of 800+ people was common.  Unfortunately, the lower you are on the totem pole, the tougher it is. The lowest level employees, the Program Assistants and Program Coordinators have it the worst. The treatment they received from higher ups was often thoughtless as if they were lesser humans and sometimes bordered on abusive. Many people who are Senior Program Officers and above demand to be waited on hand and foot. Example: many of them don't know how or refuse to print their own documents.   HR is completely ineffective. They will always take the side of the higher ranking employee. Staying out of the cross hairs of others is your best and probably only defense."
