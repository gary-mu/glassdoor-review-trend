"Moving at the speed of light, burn out is inevitable",2013-06-21,"Program Manager in Mountain View, CA",4,,"1) Food, food, food. 15+ cafes on main campus (MTV) alone. Mini-kitchens, snacks, drinks, free breakfast/lunch/dinner, all day, errr'day.  2) Benefits/perks. Free 24:7 gym access (on MTV campus). Free (self service) laundry (washer/dryer) available. Bowling alley. Volley ball pit. Custom-built and exclusive employee use only outdoor sport park (MTV). Free health/fitness assessments. Dog-friendly. Etc. etc. etc.  3) Compensation. In ~2010 or 2011, Google updated its compensation packages so that they were more competitive.   4) For the size of the organization (30K+), it has remained relatively innovative, nimble, and fast-paced and open with communication but, that is definitely changing (for the worse).  5) With so many departments, focus areas, and products, *in theory*, you should have plenty of opportunity to grow your career (horizontally or vertically). In practice, not true.   6) You get to work with some of the brightest, most innovative and hard-working/diligent minds in the industry. There's a ""con"" to that, too (see below).","1) Work/life balance. What balance? All those perks and benefits are an illusion. They keep you at work and they help you to be more productive. I've never met anybody at Google who actually time off on weekends or on vacations. You may not hear management say, ""You have to work on weekends/vacations"" but, they set the culture by doing so - and it inevitably trickles down. I don't know if Google inadvertently hires the work-a-holics or if they create work-a-holics in us. Regardless, I have seen way too many of the following: marriages fall apart, colleagues choosing work and projects over family, colleagues getting physically sick and ill because of stress, colleagues crying while at work because of the stress, colleagues shooting out emails at midnight, 1am, 2am, 3am. It is absolutely ridiculous and something needs to change.  2) Poor management. I think the issue is that, a majority of people love Google because they get to work on interesting technical problems - and these are the people that see little value in learning how to develop emotional intelligence. Perhaps they enjoy technical problems because people are too ""difficult."" People are promoted into management positions - not because they actually know how to lead/manage, but because they happen to be smart or because there is no other path to grow into. So there is a layer of intelligent individuals who are horrible managers and leaders. Yet, there is no value system to actually do anything about that because ""emotional intelligence"" or ""adaptive leadership"" are not taken seriously.  3) Jerks. Sure, there are a lot of brilliant people - but, sadly, there are also a lot of jerks (and, many times, they are one and the same). Years ago, that wasn't the case. I don't know if the pool of candidates is getting smaller, or maybe all the folks with great personalities cashed out and left, or maybe people are getting burned out and it's wearing on their personality and patience. I've heard stories of managers straight-up cussing out their employees and intimidating/scaring their employees into compliance.  4) It's a giant company now and, inevitably, it has become slower moving and is now layered with process and bureaucracy. So many political battles, empire building, territory grabbing. Google says, ""Don't be evil."" But, that practice doesn't seem to be put into place when it comes to internal practices. :("
"Great balance between big-company security and fun, fast-moving projects",2014-05-10,"Software Engineer III in New York, NY",5,,"* If you're a software engineer, you're among the kings of the hill at Google. It's an engineer-driven company without a doubt (that *is* changing, but it's still very engineer-focused). * The perks are amazing. Yes, free breakfast, lunch, an dinner every weekday. Aaaaaamazing holiday parties (at Waldorf Astoria, NY Public Library, MoMA, etc.); overnight ski trips to Vermont; overnight nature trips to the Poconos in the summer; summer picnics at Chelsea piers; and on and on and on. I don't see this going away unless the company starts hurting financially. * Speaking of which, the company is doing quite well, which reflects in bonuses and equity grants. * There a huge diversity of work ranging from defending independent journalism worldwide (Google Project Shield) to crisis response during disasters (see Maps during Hurricane Sandy or Tsunamis), to the best machine learning experts and projects in the world, to more mundane revenue-driving projects in advertising, there's really something for everybody. * It's easy to move around within the company as long as you're in good standing (the vast majority of engineers are). * The company is amazingly open: every week Larry Page and Sergey Brin host what's called TGIF where food, beer, wine, etc. is served, a new project is presented, and afterward there's an open forum to ask the executives anything you want. It's truly fair game to ask anything, no matter how controversial, and frequently the executives will be responsive. * No, nobody cares if you use an iPhone, Facebook, shop with Amazon, stream using Spotify, or refuse to use Google+. The company is amazingly open and flexible.  Neither pro nor con, but general information on work-life balance, promotions, and advancement. * Work life balance can be what you want it to be on most teams. (Some teams are in more competitive sectors and require more crazy hours all the time - but very few of them). If you do what's expected, you'll be fine at least for a handful of years. Working a roughly 40 hour work week is possible, and many people do it. There are also people who are hyper-motived and work like crazy just because they love it, or because they're competitive, or they want to get a promotion. If you work 40 hour weeks without putting in anything extra, you'll fall behind them as they advance and you stand still - and maybe that doesn't matter, so it works out for everybody. But at least know where you would realistically stand. * If you excel and work your butt off, you'll be compensated and promoted. If you let yourself be a code monkey, and just sit coding with your head down all day, you'll be fine but won't advance. A big complaint from some Googlers is about not being able to advance ""even at Google"" with pure coding. Sure, if you're the uber genius who created MapReduce and Bigtable, you're going to advance like a rocket without having to do anything but coding; but if you're like most engineers at Google -- smarter than average, but just average compared to other Googlers -- you're just a good coder and not revolutionary. Code monkeys are important to actually get stuff done, and to be sure you absolutely need to be a good coder as a software engineer (it's the minimum requirement), but code monkeys won't advance because they're not leaders and they're easy to replace. To get promoted you need to lead and do more than just code. There are plenty of ways to lead other than being an official tech lead, so this isn't actually _that_ hard, so the real point is just that you can't just sit there coding what other people tell you to code all day and expect to advance.","* It *is* becoming larger, and with it comes growing pains: bureaucracy, slow to respond to market threats, bloated teams, cross-divisional tension (though nothing remotely approaching that of Microsoft's internal tension). * The quality of the engineers is possibly dropping, but possibly not. It's hard to get real metrics, because as the absolute number of people grows, naturally the number of bad apples grows; as a percentage it's supposedly the same as it ever was, but with larger numbers of poorer quality engineers it just _feels_ like things might be changing for the worse. * Also with growth means more internal-confidential data leaks (again, because of the raw numbers of people) -- product announcements being ruined, etc. That means the company has to be tighter-lipped internally to avoid leaks, which makes things less open. It's still an amazingly open place, but less so than it was even a couple years ago. The good thing is they recognize it and actively look to improve things because they know how important it is to keep the good culture."
The best place I've worked and also the most demanding.,2015-02-08,"in Mountain View, CA",5,,"You can't find a more well-regarded company that actually deserves the hype it gets.  You'll work on cutting edge projects / solve important issues that impact your community and the world  You'll meet interesting people who are your colleagues, managers, and senior management.  You'll open the paper and see your company in the news almost every day, and read about projects you're working on, which is a cool thing  You'll see Larry and Sergey at TGIF and you'll admire how they lead the company. They are brilliant, goofy, low key but intense, and likeable.   There are 22 cafes (more or less), the food is excellent, and it's free.  Your pay will typically be competitive, though it needs to be tweaked up a bit since the economy has improved.  Google cares about how it treats its employees.  The campus is like an academic campus in many ways.  There are tons of activities on campus, like authors speaking about their books, films after work, and gyms where you can work out - but you'll need to make sure to carve out time to do these things.  You'll get plenty of external validation from people who suddenly think you're smart and rich because you work there, even if you're not rich and you're as smart when you didn't work at Google.  If and when you leave, you'll never regret having that company on your resume. It opens doors.   The company is flexible - if you're lucky, you won't have a micromanager boss and you can be somewhat flexible in how you work - but don't get me wrong - you'll work a LOT. But you don't have to do all of it chained to your desk.","I live in SF so the commute can take between 1.5 hours to 1.75 hours each way on the shuttle - sometimes 2 hours each way on a busy day or rainy day. That means being on the bus for 3-4 hours PER DAY. It's a wired bus though which means you can work on the way to Mountain View. But it can feel brutal.  Your first year or two are really important in terms of your career at Google and they affect how you're viewed, and your ability to be promoted. You should always ask to work on high profile projects. If you don't get them, don't expect to get high ratings or get promoted. Always volunteer for cross functional group work for maximum exposure, and then work hard at those things.  You'll likely work on something that no one will explain to you and it will take you at least a year to be comfortable doing what you're working on, even if you're super quick at learning. No one has time to train you or teach you what you're doing - which is kind of hard.  After two or three years, people you started out with at Google start to get promoted. If you're not one of them, you'll wonder why and how it happened, and that process is somewhat political and not always clear.   It's a big company now. And super political. So don't be naive. Expect some people to be catty, some people to be territorial, and be prepared to be mentally tough. Don't let people see your vulnerableness. It's a Darwinistic culture with a huge dose of 30-something idealism on top which can fool you into thinking that people are easygoing - they're not. They're driven. If you're not driven, you're not going to fit in.  When you start at Google, it seems like peer reviews are super important - they are, but they are the sprinkles on the fro yo. The important thing is that your direct manager knows your work, likes your work and likes you, and then you can get promoted. If your boss doesn't like you, all the positive peer reviews in the world won't help you. Make sure you know what your boss wants, and give it to them. You will have weekly one on ones, and make sure you are addressing your performance at each one, asking if they have questions, how you can improve, can you work on cross functional projects, etc.  It's really hard to find work life balance at Google. The workload is huge. I hardly have time to work out. The commute is brutal. My family sometimes needs more from me and I can't give it. I'm still trying to find the balance. I think I need more down time than most people so I have a hard time being structured every day to fit all the things I want into my day, so a lot of things slip, like working out."
Working at Google,2023-04-25,"Mid Market Account Executive in New York, NY",3,,"Superb benefits, including full 401k match, excellent health and dental care + the famous office perks Google is a company that needs no introduction, and as an employee, I can attest that it is a rewarding, if strange, place to work. On the one hand, the benefits are as great as you would expect from a tech giant like Google. In addition, the overall work environment is positive, as colleagues are generally friendly, supportive, motivated, and intelligent.","The job itself can be a strange one. A lot of time is spent creating work for yourself, as opposed to actually doing the work necessary to grow clients. Google, especially GBO, is very overstaffed, which leads to a lot of weird gamesmanship to try to get promoted. This includes making up weird groups, pointless sales initiatives, taking credit for things that just happen as opposed to being the result of actual effort on the part of the sales staff. As a result, people are rewarded not necessarily for their ability to sell, but for how well they can play the corporate game at Google. In other words, how well they are able to present themselves to management as the ideal Google employee, as opposed to actually being effective at selling."
Fall of a great company culture,2023-02-25,"Android Engineer in Seattle, WA",3,,"I've been at Google a long time, so the financial benefits still outweigh any cons. The people I work with are still mostly great, especially most of my management chain (though one or two are no-ops).","The company was founded on psychological safety, don't be evil, hire smart creatives, etc.. Today, the company has grown so fast and so large that now the majority of people seem to be typical tech industry employees. That means most of the management has now come from outside the company, so that has killed the culture. Psychological safety is gone, especially after the way the layoffs were handled. I miss Laszlo Bock; he knew how to treat the workforce. I miss Larry, Sergey, and Eric. The general quality of my peers has gone down. Not as people, they're all lovely, but as practitioners. Most of them do what we'd have considered low-quality work 5 years ago. It's shockingly bad, really, by comparison. They've all been hired so fast and in such an environment where they weren't properly trained or didn't have the proper background to begin with or haven't been given the time and mentorship required to become great (investing in people)."
Great place to learn how to survive in a corporate environment but needs some work,2023-04-07,"GBO in Detroit, MI",4,,"- Great salary, benefits and equity - Amenities are wonderful, when you can use them - Great people, your peers are truly folks that care - Visibility, I knew what was happening for Google as a company through frequent e-mails from our CEO. - Ability to grow many skillsets that are transferrable outside of Google.","- Hard to get work accomplished cross functionally, misaligned OKRs - Too many priorities make it confusing for your Googlers to truly understand what is important (this would be a few things not 10 + smaller ones). This is burning your team out. - Develop your leaders, teach skillsets that help them to be even more successful in their current role and in developing their teams - When talking about stress management and mindfulness, build it into your work not just in an even tone a year. - Create more vision for your organization, not just the revenue goals but the purpose of the team and where we are going in a way that aligns to the human impact not just the revenue impact"
Can you please provide more context or details?,2023-04-02,"Account Manager in New York, NY",5,,"Innovative and Collaborative Culture: Google's culture values creativity, innovation, and teamwork, which means you'll be working with talented individuals who are passionate about their work. Perks and Benefits: Google offers amazing perks and benefits to its employees, such as free meals, on-site fitness centers, and comprehensive health insurance. Career Development Opportunities: Google invests in its employees' career development by providing opportunities for professional growth and learning, such as training programs, mentorship, and career coaching.","employees may feel pressure to constantly perform at a high level to meet company expectations. Long Hours: Some positions at Google may require long hours and tight deadlines, which could impact work-life balance. Bureaucracy: Google is a large company with a complex organizational structure, which may lead to bureaucratic processes and slow decision-making. Limited Career Advancement: While Google does offer many opportunities for professional growth, some employees may find that career advancement is limited due to the highly competitive nature of the company."
"Financial health up, mental health down",2023-03-27,Director of Customer Success,3,,"The benefits and financial stability and growth I enjoyed over my years at Google helped me avoid so much financial anxiety faced by my peers, and I know how lucky I was to have them.","The culture is in rapid decline. There is rampant use of corporate speak, and Googlers who can't read between the lines effectively suffer constant performance anxiety. There is a lot of talk about roles having clear objectives that prevent bias, but in practice there is plenty of subjectivity, and the Googlers that succeed are those that devote their energies to internal upward management. You are told constantly that it's a different sort of company - and you are expected to agree - in spite of so much evidence to the contrary."
Very manager dependent,2023-04-12,"Program Manager in New York, NY",1,,- Legacy of good values - Some older Googlers are great and foster a good culture,"- Very very manager driven environment - Lack of understanding of direction and strategy. Try and fail fast mentality leads to many issues as the company's scale can no longer support such an attitude - Entreprenuerial to an extent that there is very little support as you are new to the firm. This organization is a monster of its own to navigate - unlike any in the industry. Without the nature of guidance that initial googlers could access because of smaller scale, many nooglers struggle - Touts as being OKR driven but at a closer look you can see that there is intense data manipulation and storyline projection to show that they met OKRs. OKRs are often shifted - sometimes at the end of the review cycle - contrary to public image, they prefer only aggressive type As and it is sometimes upsetting to see the level of politics that exists - There is no diversity w.r.t personality types. If you are in with the cool crowd - you are in. Else you will struggle."

The bottom-up, dev-focused mentality still exists to some extent, but bureaucracy, mandates, and managerial office politics are all getting more prevalent. Leadership decisions are increasingly opaque and crassly unconcerned with employee opinions.   * Hiring standards have plummeted with the rapid expansion starting in the late 2010s. Combined with the widely available materials and coaching for passing Google interviews, this has led to a lot more incompetent people getting into the company at all levels.   * The company is agonizingly slow to fire people for performance reasons. This means if you have teammates, reports, or (the worse) managers who are incompetent, they could linger in their positions for a year or years being minimally productive - or even actively counterproductive - before they are let go.   * You'd often think the company was struggling to make ends meet, rather than profiting tens of billions of dollars per year. Perks are being suspended or cut, mass layoffs occurred without warning, and the already haphazard hiring pipeline has been frozen on and off. Upper management maintains that this is all the result of economic headwinds and long term strategy, versus propping up the wealth of the major shareholders."

The work/life balance is great (although beware meetings with other timezones) and there is a lot of flexibility.  The expectations are almost nil - it's impossible to get fired, unless you completely stop showing up.  The benefits and pay are good (not the best in the industry, but better than most).  Some of the older technology was (and sometimes still is) genuinely groundbreaking. You can learn a lot by studying it. If you're an engineer, find someone senior who has been there for 10+ years to learn from: most of those people are extremely impressive, if they haven't left yet.","Most of the senior leadership changed from 2015 to about 2018, and the new people are the most ""meh"" uninspiring bunch of caretakers I've ever seen. Above director level, leadership seems to only care about PR and cutting costs - nobody has any kind of product vision or the guts to try anything new. Any innovative product someone manages to produce gets killed immediately. Any new acquisitions get bogged down in senseless bureaucracy.  The old leadership leaving triggered a chain reaction that's still ongoing, and has now reached tech lead and line manager levels. Most of the best people left or mostly checked out.  There's nothing wrong with wanting a simple 9-5 job, but Google today is something else: it's soul-crushing how much nobody cares anymore, and how disincentivized you are from actually trying to ship a product for end-users. If you actually try to get anything done, you will be the only one, and it'll suck life out of you.  On paper, this might sound like a nice, chill gig, but human beings are not meant to do nothing. The complete lack of goals or vision in the company will start getting to you sooner or later, and it is depressing.  Consider: this is a well-funded business with lots of infrastructure and resources, and the leadership chooses to do absolutely nothing with them."

Great for stability. Bad if you have ambitions.,2013-03-30,"Inside Sales Representative in Mountain View, CA",3,,"- Great, great perks. They really make you feel taken care of as an employee and as a person. - Great pride when you realize how the company is changing the world in a positive way and you are part of it. - Really nice people with not many big egos.","- Little career progression. The company likes to think they are flat but in reality they have deep hierarchical leves (There were 10 people between me and the CEO) but there is no clear way to become manager and each manager manages 12 or more people. - Sales is an afterthought completely. The engineers are rightfully the stars but for the sales people the salaries are half what you can earn in other places. - In spite that they say otherwise, pedigree counts a lot. Top salesman globally with no brand name makes half (counting comission, bonuses, stock, etc.) of what another salesman makes as base salary and comes from the ""right"" (Ivy league, big names on resume) background. - If you are not in the right group your day to day work is boring and mundane.  - Low engagement of people with their jobs (in the sales org). That makes for very uninteresting meal chats about ski trips and vegas conventions."
Contracted Recruiting Coordinator at Google,2019-01-30,"Recruiting Coordinator in Mountain View, CA",5,,"1. As a contractor, you are treated with respect 2. Benefits (Cafés, gym, transportation) are excellent 3. You get to be part of one of the most innovative companies on the planet","1. If you are a contractor attempting to convert to an FTE (full time employee) role, it is quite difficult, requires exceptional metrics during your contract position, and is met with heavy competition.  2. The pay is worse, the stock options are non-existent, and there is a slight divide between FTE's and TVC's, when you work as a TVC at Google. A good example of a divide: TVC's are not invited to company events (e.g. holiday party).  3. It can be difficult to keep a work life balance (although it is not expected for you to overwork yourself)."

You can learn a lot at Google and hack on things easily. There are things to improve though.,2013-01-26,"Software Engineer II in Mountain View, CA",4,,"The single most important factor for me is that you can learn a lot here. You can meet many great people, who contributed a lot to CS in general. When you want to improve your skills in particular area, you can join the team that works on that area. Also the codebase is huge with multiple examples of great engineering. Google has some internal learning classes etc. but I didn't find it as useful as people, projects and the codebase.  Another thing is the ""hackability"". With the tools we have it's very simple to start hacking on something and you can focus on solving problems. If you have an idea that you want to try, often you can have something ready within a day or two with no frustrations coming from fighting the tools all the time.","I think that internal mobility could be improved. It's easy to start to work on something as 20%, but when it comes to 100% it's a bit tricky. That means you can get stuck for a while in a project that you don't really like.  Also there is certain degree of bureaucracy. Maybe it's just me, but I hate creating tickets and filling e-forms. Whenever you want to request something, you need to do those things."

Great place to work,2016-12-18,Anonymous Employee,5,,"Everything you hear about in the news about the great work culture and perks are true.

Some shouldn't be managers, but have been promoted to managerial positions based on their strong individual contributions and expertise, but this isn't a good proxy for being a good people manager."

At first it was great as I was in the Platinum tier. Then I dropped to Gold, and now I'm struggling in the Silver tier. There are two more tiers below Silver - I can only imagine what they're making per message. I make a conscious effort to style the client by their specific needs - yet my pay or tier does not reflect my work. Pods are always empty - I can style about 3 clients/hr on a good day with this new pay model. I worked for 6 hrs yesterday and made $39 - absolutely terrible. The system is supposed to catch if you've sent items before, sometimes it doesn't and you send the client an item they've already disliked. This system fault leads to stylists' failures."

They allow honor system style time off for sickness as long as it is not abused. They have a large pool of talent and they look great on a resume.,"The top levels of management are arrogant and inattentive. They seem to very self interested and only spout pre rehearsed, scripted answers to important questions. Promotions and reviews are based on your managers mood. The management is so flat that some managers have legions of googlers rolling up into them. This makes it very hard to stand out. The perks are there to put stars in your eyes so you won't see that there is very little opportunity for career advancement of nay note."
Great at the beginning,2019-05-11,Stylist,3,,"Remote online styling. Flexible schedule. Work whenever you can. Fun work.

And be apart of the Tailor community to be informed about what’s going on and learn from others.","Compensation. Lack of training and support. No one-on-one or even Zoom support. Very strange pay determinate. One week I’m at a certain tier and if I do they same work, I get lowered to another tier making my pay and time uncertain. Lots of stylist are confused and frustrated. At the beginning I could make $300 to $400 every two weeks as a side job. But now I barely make $100 every two weeks. Partly bc of the lack of motivation but also bc it doesn’t seem worth it anymore. I love this job but I can justify working for the amount of money I’m making now."

In house doctors, free food (really gourmet food), great technology and truly encourages innovation.

Which is not desirable, makes systems unnecessarily complex. Management needs to put a roadmap before the engineer otherwise the rocket scientist engineer will starts to make the simple piece a complete rocket, which forever will need rocket scientists to maintain.

The work place is very open, interaction with other employees is very easy. It is filled with very intelligent and fun people. The company is very open, you can ask questions directly to the CEO or Founders during TGIF question and answer sessions. Interns don't get nearly as much perks and benefits as full time employees, but that's expected. Google probably has one of the highest pays for interns. It is definitely one of the best places to work at.",Promotions don't seem to happen too often due to the fact that there is very short chain of command and little bureaucracy.
Getting to be a big company but still treats employees well,2017-07-08,"Staff Software Engineer in Mountain View, CA",5,,"- Great Benefits (Meals, Transportation, Gyms, on-site doctors and physical therapists) - Great co-workers - Upper Management are real humans who genuinely care about others and get up in front of everyone every week and answer arbitrary questions  -- you might not like the answers but the fact that they're even up there is still amazing - Depending on which area you're in but work/life balance is quite good","- (Depends a lot on where you are ) Work might be less interesting than you want  - Promotion system can be very demoralizing because you're being judged by others who may not have full context. So it incentivizes ""salesmanship"" which is not a skill that everyone has. - keeps getting bigger every year, so it becomes harder to have the same levels of trust, benefits, etc as before - new CFO is putting the hammer down (This might actually be a good thing as I think there were a lot of wasteful projects before)"
Tough but interesting place to be a lawyer,2013-12-23,"Corporate Counsel in Mountain View, CA",3,,"The work is cutting edge and career-making. By the contacts you make and the experience you can have, as well as the name on your resume, it is door-opening. You will work with one of the smartest collections of people in the world, with every perk known in employment. One thing I'll say is that shared offices are often seen as a negative but are actually quite a plus for most people.","For the lawyer hired post IPO, the pay is low and the hours are long. I'd prefer better compensation than all the perks - many of which I could not really use because I was working too hard. Things change frequently and working with some of the smartest people comes with a price, which is often a high level of arrogance - even disdain for lawyers. Maybe it's what keeps the Google business more successful. Aside from that, Google legal is now like a big law firm - that many lawyers. Lots of layers of management."

Its not entirely bad changes, just different than before. - Long commute from San Francisco with minimal flexibility. Company is losing good employees as they move their offices further south to Sunnyvale or San Jose. Longer commutes on buses are taking major tolls on employees health (back pain, tech neck). Physical Therapists, Chiropractors, and Massage Therapists are basically acting as a triage department for these issues. - Can be hard to switch between job ""ladders"" if you don't love your current field"

The Google name holds a lot of weight when you want to have a meeting with any partners or vendors, or want to go to a conference.","It all depends on the team. Avoid the People Operations ""Global People Services"" (GPS) team. The leadership of that organization (the Vice-President) is very hierarchical, is not transparent, is very top-down, and keeps around managers who consistently get bad reviews from their directs. Nothing is done when HR reports are filed. This is ironic since this organization sits within HR. The culture is toxic, and employees are told that the best way to get promoted is to listen to what managers say and follow their lead. It is very different from the rest of the culture at Google."
Literally the Worst,2018-10-29,"Remote Stylist in Pittsburgh, PA",1,,If I could give this 0 stars I would. In theory this is a great job but there are no pros,There is NO WORK !! When I started I was busy and making really good money and over the last 6 months its just gotten slower to the point of no work at all. To the person who said she got more work because she had quality messages that just isn't true and that review was most likely a fake one from the company . All the stylist complain about having no work and I know personally I get really great feedback from the clients and other stylists.  They will literally hire anyone. There are stylists on this app that have the worst grammar ( like you can barely understand them) and clearly no fashion or styling background.  There is no interaction from Tailor the company. Stylists always ask why there is no work and they give the same canned response that just says you need to give better quality messages.   Its a total waste of time and energy to try to get work on this app.

Managers need to be good to get their reports promoted. Being on the ""right"" project (aka high impact with high visibility) does affect substantially career growth."
A Lifetime of Operations at a Tech Company,2013-08-07,"Ads Quality Senior Strategist in Mountain View, CA",5,,"The roles have been challenging, dynamic, interesting, ambiguous and evolving. The people that I've gotten to work with are great (for the most part)--smart, driven, effective--they're what has kept me around for so long.","Bias towards the new, shiny, sexy projects often leaves Operations teams and other cost centers at a loss for resources and support.

If you're happy you're more productive."" I'm happy indeed :)","Work-life balance can be difficult, not necessarily due to management asking you to work off-hours, but because sometimes it's hard to disconnect."

Team REALLY matters,2011-11-22,"in Chicago, IL",5,,"Really smart people, great benefits, amazing level of transparency and access, people -especially at the top are really committed to ""getting it right""",Essentially Google has more than a few terrible middle managers. This is mostly because the really great people will often leave for school or more lucrative opportunities (because getting promotions can be very difficult) and often the people who stay are those who bide their time and are solid but not rock start performers. So your Google experience will depend a lot on who your direct manager is...

Beyond the point of being disrespectful at times. I've seen this from the top leadership time and again. Eventually I had to leave because of a conflict with personal values. Funny thing is, those at the top were simply there first/ longest, and they are generally less competent than many of the most junior employees. Heavy bureaucracy. Kinda ridiculous to see how tactical management can get (I mean,the CMO providing feedback on a product web site), and the sheer lack of a well communicated strategy for the business (ie, I do think Larry sets a good company vision and priorities)."

A lot of people are being hired for MTV, CA office. High compensation is offset by huge rent or real estate prices. Or choose long commute.

Bureaucracy, slow to respond to market threats, bloated teams, cross-divisional tension. The quality of the engineers is possibly dropping with lots of unexperienced engineers.

The perks are fantastic, too — there is no easy nor compelling way to argue against free hot meals up to three times a day, and there's always something exciting or interesting or intellectually challenging to work on.

If you're savvy enough you can find your way into working on some pretty cool things.",Too many people doing jobs they're overqualified for. This leads to increased employee dissatisfaction and turnover. It can also cause a bit of overhead as intelligent people look to inject meaning/impact into low impact roles. Also be cautious of the job descriptions when applying. They can be intentionally vague and you may end up doing something you have absolutely no interest in. Far too often have I seen a person take almost any job just to get in the door and end up miserable.

An impressive roof over rotting rafters,2019-10-09,Staff Software Engineer,1,,Compensation and perks make for a materially comfortable environment,"Don't believe the glowing reviews. The company may seem fantastic if you're a fresh graduate who's still overawed by free food and on-site laundry. But once you reach the higher levels, you'll realize that the company has become a cloying, insular, and claustrophobic place. Internal technology falls further behind the outside world every day, but people still speak and act like they did when Google was years ahead of everyone else. It's an environment of total hubris.  God help you if you try to rock the boat. If you do, people snipe at you in design documents, slander your work and your mannerisms behind your back, and undermine you in performance reviews, all the while presenting just enough of a friendly facade to maintain plausible deniability. Nobody will tell you what's really going on. Very few people are interested in technical excellence. The joke is that Google hires the smartest people to ""move protos"" (i.e., do drudge work) all day. It took me years to realize that the ""move protos"" meme resonates because the L7-L9 old-time clique comes down like a fist on anyone trying to do more than make uncreative, incremental, and low-impact changes.  Maybe you don't care about technical excellence. If you don't, you won't be alone: ""merit"" and ""heroism"" are dirty words at Google. Maybe you want to work your 10-4 job, land a few CLs, eat your free lunch, get your middling performance scores, and collect your above-average paycheck, all the while crusading on memegen or whining about how unfair it is that the company evaluates your performance twice per year. If that's what you want to do, Google is the place for you. But if you're the kind of person who wants to advance technology, to apply your intellect to hard problems, and to bring something new into the world, then (unless you get extraordinarily lucky with team placement) Google will suffocate you. Go anywhere else."

Growing pains,2015-05-14,"Finance Director in New York, NY",5,,Terrific colleagues. Growing business. Amazing spirit and smarts. Great food.,Large and complex organization. Hierarchical. Silo'd. Unable to keep pace with other tech companies.
Compensation Associate,2018-09-13,"Associate Compensation Analyst in Mountain View, CA",5,,"Great team, high level work output, very principled",Performance review and promotion process has a lot of room for improvement across Google
"Great Salary, Benefits, and Flexibility",2020-05-30,"Software Engineer in Mountain View, CA",5,,"It's just a very flexible place to work, as a Software Engineer. I always felt like my voice was being heard, I was given lots of agency, and was trusted.","Honestly, my main complaint was ""Google is a Monopoly, and that made me uncomfortable"". Mileage may vary."
"Google is still a great company, but could work on more individual employee attention.",2008-06-11,"Staff Software Engineer in Mountain View, CA",4,,"Google's management allows, or rather, encourages engineers to take as much ownership as they like of projects. Product managers are there to work with engineers to direct the product, as their job is to know the customers and the marketplace and come up with a good direction for products. Because a lot of what the marketplace wants is illogical, engineers often argue with product management, and such behavior is part of what makes engineering a great place to be. You can actually have a significant impact on product direction.  Additionally, Google is very fair about how promotions work. The engineers who impress their colleagues get promoted. Those who don't impress their colleagues don't get promoted. Thus, most good engineers will get promoted. I've heard lots of people complain about this process, but usually I hear this from engineers who aren't that impressive. It could be that the explanation for *why* they aren't getting promoted isn't transparent enough...but I don't know.  In almost all situations, you are in control of your own destiny at Google. You set your own goals. You set your own timeline to achieve those goals. Management is there to guide you in setting these goals, but it is your duty to set good goals and strive to achieve them. This is also very empowering, and avoids the micromanagement that occurs at other companies.  Then there's the obvious, which everyone else has already mentioned, like the *great* food, the massages, the really understanding/flexible management when it comes to personal issues, the good benefit package, etc.","Google is big, so your impact often seems tiny with regard to the company as a whole. Things are gradually getting more and more bureaucratic, the pain of being a public company with profits to protect. You gradually feel less and less important to the company as time goes on, as the company grows to many 10s of thousands of employees. Things like the Founder's Awards, which originally were supposed to be motivating factors to great products could end up being demotivating for many. For example, if you are stuck on a project that is in maintenance mode, or if you launch a great product that is overlooked, you might have little motivation to work hard again."
"Great engineers, mediocre managers.",2008-06-12,"Software Engineer in Mountain View, CA",4,,"The quality of my co-workers is phenomenal. You can be sure that any idea you might have will be thorougly analyzed and considered. People are friendly, intelligent and in the vast majority of cases very easy to get along with.  The infrastructure that Google has built up really frees the programmer from a lot of fundamental worries and allows him or her to concentrate on solving the high-level problem. The available tools make accessing a tremendous amount of computing power very straightforward.  I have always been satisfied with my managers trust me when I say I need to take time off or work from home. It is very liberating to know that your manager supports you when you need this kind of latitude because of things happening outside work.","I believe that the quality of the middle management leaves a lot to be desired. I find the quality of middle managers to be extremely variable. I believe some managers do not actively contribute to a good outcome for the team. Also, I believe that Google is not good at weeding out those managers who do not perform well.  Google's ""slotting"" process is terrible. I know many instances of people who have applied for positions that interest them, only to be ""slotted"" into positions which they do not like. Once you are slotted, it is very difficult to move out of your position. It could take months, maybe even a year or so.  Also, these same middle managers have sole control over your quarterly evaluation. These evaluations feed into your annual bonus, so if you are incorrectly slotted and do not perform to the best of your abilities, then you are triply penalized: your evaluations will be poor, your bonus will go down and it will become harder for you to transfer to another team."
Google is a nice place to work,2008-06-22,"Team Lead in Mountain View, CA",4,,"There are many things to highlight here: the talented people I work with; the perks (there are really good stuff here, life a awesome health insurance, gym, plenty off food, etc). And why not mention the prestige to work on such famous company. This can really open a lot of door both currently and in the future.",The amount of things we have in our plates. The workload seems to be overwhelming now and then. Sometimes it is difficult to find the balance between you personal and professional life. But the company has been working hard in this issue to.
"Awesome perks and work environment, frustrations around career path",2008-07-02,"Online Operations Strategist in Mountain View, CA",4,,"Bright interesting coworkers; the opportunity to take on lots of responsibility and potentially be responsible for large numbers of users or dollars very quickly; free food; health benefits. There are incredible outside speakers who come (Obama, Hillary Clinton). You'll probably only be able to see them on video unless you devote hours of your workday to waiting in line to see them in person, but it's still live and pretty darn cool!  I work in Online Sales and Operations, where pretty much everyone gets a weekly one-on-one meeting with their manager. That is one upside to working in the sales organization as opposed to some other areas of the company. Many engineers have limited facetime with their manager.","Total compensation is good, but your base salary will be low. You'll make up for it in bonus and the cost of not having to buy breakfast and lunch. You won't get the bonus if you're on leave (i.e., medical leave, maternity leave, etc) so you'll end up getting a lower slice of your total compensation than you might at some companies that provide a higher base salary.   There is huge variation among managers in the sales organization. Some have no experience managing people, some have experience but still aren't good managers, and some are great.   People who think up innovative new ideas are recognized and compensated better than people who do all the work to implement those ideas. Depending on where you are on the ""thinking up crazy new ideas"" scale, you this may be a downside for you.  Expectations aren't clearly set in the online sales organization--you can discuss with your manager ad naseum what the expectations are, what projects to complete, etc. but you can never be assured of a particular reward (performance rating, bonus, promotion) for completing everything you discuss. Basically your manager can't promise you anything. This is un-motivating for me personally; you may or may not be motivated by this structure.  Engineering is king at Google--you may develop an inferiority complex if you are not in engineering. They won't even give the same headphones to non-engineers as they will to engineers. I tried requesting them and was denied!  Online Sales and Operations is not very flexible about work-life stuff, such as telecommuting a couple of days a month, arriving late in the morning, etc. It is fine to do it every now and again if you ask permission from your manager in advance and have a valid reason like an appointment. Engineering offers much more flexibility in this area."
Best place in the world,2008-11-07,"Software Engineering in Mountain View, CA",5,,"Simple a great place to work. There are plenty of videos and articles about how Google is the best place to work, and it's all true.","None, at all. Seriously. If anything they provide such a great work environment that I don't want to leave... ever."

"When No One ""Owns"" Decisions and Managers Fail to Lead, It's Easy for People to Coast",2010-02-05,"Non-engineer in New York, NY",2,,"-Great food -Internal transparency when it comes to what projects are being worked on (not transparent on things like promotions) -Lots of stuff going on -Always changing -Fun people -Great location in NYC -Speakers and authors visit Google--great perk! -Concierge team helps arrange discounts, etc. -In-house massage (I will miss that!) -Good for the resume -Great place to meet future start-up partners. Cool techie environment. Learn the latest and greatest in the tech world as it develops.","-Biggest problem at Google = poor managers who lack leadership skills. My manager never once created an annual or quarterly strategic business plan. He (actually *I*) filled in the template given by management, but he never created a plan we could work toward. As a result, people did what they wanted, which was not always most profitable (in part because short term incentives don't align with long term profitability). This created a lot of problems. In 2007, the company created a new layer of middle-manager jobs and hired people internally...without training them to be managers! Disaster. Lots of inefficiency and broken promises. Horrible decision that continues to plague employees. There are some good managers, I just didn't work with any.  -No career development. Minimal worthwhile training. You can take a course here and there, but when it comes to moving around the company, watch out. Sales, Engineering, and Enterprise are silos---you can't move between them. *Everyone* complains about this. Smart people have for years been talking about leaving. -They fired most of HR in 2009 (the others have always been contract workers without benefits); what remains of HR is really weak. HR is never helpful anyway. -No one ""owns"" decisions (not even managers or their managers!), but everyone gets a say...so few risks get taken and greatness rarely evolves beyond the idea stage -There's a lot of mediocrity; why improve when improvement might require you or teammates to work a little smarter or harder? Lots of resistance to change that requires more work. -Flat organization is bad for people whose work shows skill beyond job level / area & typical promotion cycles (senior management encouraged national sales team to think of lateral moves as promotions...even though you don't make more money, get better titles--and then must start the promotion journey afresh as if you had never worked there before) -Salary. When Google offered me the job, a well-known, respected web property with a similar job did as well. The latter offered me TWICE as much money as Google. Twice! And all the good benefits.  -Salary increases over time. When you're promoted, you don't make all that much more. Bonuses are small (and taxed at 50%). Options are not worth as much as you think. And you don't get as much stock as you think, either. (These are taxed at 50%, too, so you don't really get very much!)  All of this relates to the non-engineering side. I always really liked the engineers and when I worked with their projects found great synergies. Unfortunate the sales side made it so hard to move over!"

"Lack of Respect, Superficial & Self-Entitled People, Lowest EQ Around Silicon Valley",2015-05-07,"Writing in Mountain View, CA",1,,"Well, you might say that it's the on-site perks that are great, but really it's all an illusion because this company operates like the Borg and expects everyone to come in, conform, and become appendages to each other and the company as a whole. Also, having free food at work is nice, if only they offered heart-healthy, diabetic-friendly options. Too bad the campus isn't in a better location -- like a downtown San Francisco one where you at least had other options within walking distance. You can take the shuttle to work, true, but that keeps you trapped in a confined space for a long period of time with other Googlers. Not a pleasant experience.","Does anyone in management or in the company as a whole have an EQ over 5? Forgot any ideas about equality, respect and cultural sensitivity. Also forget working here if you have anything more than about 5 years of experience -- they'll try to exploit the hell out of you and take advantage of any knowledge or experience that you have that isn't part of your job. And they'll bully and harass you on and off campus if you don't give them what they want. Then again, they bully and harass the local community and the local service workers -- the ones who keep the company running on a daily basis, so why would it be any different for someone over the age of 30 who actually has valuable life experience. Not a recommended place to work for anyone seeking job satisfaction of any kind."

culture,2022-05-09,Analyst,4,,"Pro: Animals Welcome.  Many Google offices are animal friendly. The most extreme example is their California office which makes use of goats to keep their lawns neatly grazed, but many other offices also encourage their staff to bring their dogs to work, to improve wellbeing. Another initiative also provides pushbikes to ride around the Google Campus in an eco-friendly way.","Con: Work-life balance – not always balanced.  Many modern American companies have developed a contrived culture of lingering at work. Ambitious, new or young talent may end up hanging out at the office outside of work hours, often working or learning. This can develop into peer pressure to spend a lot of time at the office. Apart from coffee shops and libraries, some places have “sleep pods” for that swift power nap to help you keep going for longer. The Toronto Office even has a crazy golf putting green on the roof!"

Adapt to the elitist environment and you have a safe place to rest with average comp+perks,2022-05-30,"Software Engineer in London, England",1,,"- Hard to get fired with easy work and weak underperforming colleagues to measure up to. - Free food - not great - but ""free"". - Come here to rest [strikeout]and vest[/strikeout].","- The average developer in Google is a far shot from being a great engineer despite all the ""prestige"". This reflects in an aging tech stack, poor code quality, overcomplicated designs that are glorified in a self-fulfulling game of showing off how much complexity engineers can come up with. Surprisingly sketchy practices on some core products. A lot of the 10+ yoe engineers here have been at no other company and know little of the outside world or technology progress. - This company is super frugal - to the point of being just plain cheap. This is a far shot from the reputation it has of having extraordinary perks and a fun environment to work at. Offices are very average for today's standards even compared to much smaller companies. Management dumps corpspeak on Googlers every other week and feels old school corporatey. Open memegen (the company's internal 9gag) any day of the week to see popular posts endlessly complaining about compensation, corpspeak from leadership, lack of transparency and overall self-mocking messages. It's pretty depressing and nothing ever changes. - Systematic racism + extreme in-your-face diversity consciousness advertising makes this a painfully hypocritical company to work for. - As an engineer who myself enjoys the guilty pleasure of an occasional praise, being surrounded by Googlers' continuous self praising and elitism is repulsive. Stick around employees a bit after a few drinks and you'll open up a secret world made up of an openly dirty racist bunch of humans lusting for more money and status (or might just be the London office). - Shady HR and recruitment divisions are with aggressive under the belt tactics for hiring and retention."

Google Cloud - Google by name not by culture,2022-03-15,"Cloud Sales in London, England",3,,"- All the Google perks you hear about, although most tech firms offer similar these days - outside of cloud, Google is a really cool company to work for - you get to work with some super smart people, especially those who have come from other parts of Google - Google’s charitable matching program and annual charitable give away to charities of your choice is very cool","- culture is being destroyed in Cloud through bringing in a stream of people from big consulting companies other less respected tech companies known for terrible culture and practices  - evidently the talent team sold a lot of pandemic joining nooglers on the future of Google being remote and hired people from all over the UK, yet Cloud have not granted remote working status to hardly anyone, instead everyone has to be in the office three days a week regardless - exodus expected when speaking to colleagues - despite a core Google value being respect each other, this is not the case in the UK. Bullying and retaliation are a common theme across Cloud. HR seem to bury the cases, as those in management with strings of cases against them seem to regularly get promos.  - politics and back stabbing are a daily occurrence  - lots of inexperienced people in management positions making poor decisions  - performance reviews are every 6 months and are solely based on whether you are part of your managers “in crowd” - many sales people aren’t hitting target as quotas are extreme/in achievable (don’t believe what you are told in the hiring process) - Cloud are mainly based in the least desirable Google London office in Victoria  - pay is not competitive despite what you get told - the internal sales tools are terrible (there are so many) and not fit for purpose, especially tools for tracking attainment. For a company so focused on data, the Cloud org have no clue how to manage it/make it useable/beneficial internally. you will spend a majority of your day doing admin to make sure you get paid correctly or working out your forecast, which is done in spreadsheets despite all the systems - there is an annual company survey each year in which Cloud does terribly and every year we are promised change in all the most negative areas, but real change never comes and the issues just get swept under the carpet"

A Big Company that pretends it's a Startup,2021-08-27,"Senior SRE in Dublin, Dublin",3,,"Amazing tech, excellent benefits, a very generous employer. Salaries are not top of the line, but certainly high; office amenities are well documented; there are various budgets and stipends for training and learning; out of hours on-call times get (some) time off in lieu.","Many policies are enforced unevenly, the dismissal of various ""troublemakers"" have made the news and should be reviewed carefully. There is a significant amount of gaslighting and straight up dishonesty about policies, especially around topics where it is easy to be vague such as communications and confidentiality.  The positives above only apply to Engineering teams. Life is very different in Sales, I am told.   While there are many claims about ""we're a family"" and ""community"" and so on, there is the usual strong disconnect between senior and exec management and the individual contributors at the coalface. This is expected in a huge company, but as it fails to admit that it is a huge company, it takes no steps to correct this."

Big company - safe haven,2020-10-26,"Technical Solutions Engineer in Waterloo, ON",4,,- Strong hiring process ensures that the bar is in general fairly high. Of course there are always exceptions - Decent benefits. Far better than rivals Amazon or Microsoft. But no match to other Bay Area counterparts such as Facebook or Netflix.  - Bureaucracy is there. But the company tends to be data driven and makes tough decisions based on where the data points. Which means that the typical corporate fiefdom politics will have diminishing returns in the medium to long term.,"- Big company. Which means the company culture is rather diluted in day to day experience. What really matters is the team, organization, manager and role that you sign up for - Tough to make an impact as there are plenty of smart people around. This means the ones who are well entrenched in the system tend to perform better. As a new comer, don't expect immediate success - Imposter syndrome is a real thing. But you need to remember that this is a well oiled machine and will function very well without any single individual. This includes even the CEO - Pichai. Yes, Google will run very well without him. - Expect to be low balled in terms of salary/designation. Google has plenty of applicants. And they can always find a better person for the role at a cheaper price given enough time. So be ready to eat humble pie and join on the company's terms."

It all depends on your manager and team,2016-12-22,Strategic Partner Lead,2,,"The people without a doubt. Work life balance is usually great, the meals and generally how they realise that a fun environment is inspiring. I learned amazing things that I believe are unique to Google. I love the 'everyone is an owner' culture which drives ppl to be responsible and motivates employees to do over perform.","Managers can make or break ones career at Google. You can't get ahead without senior sponsorship and if your manager is terrible, there is really not much you can do. It's also a very biased place and a place where one can experience discrimination (perhaps very specific to the office and team I was in). Finally, although you would think the opposite, job security is low as they are big fans of reorgs which can often leave you without a position for a while or in need of finding a new one internally. There is very limited HR support in these instances. I returned from maternity leave and with my new manager who had severe issues with women and maternity I suffered badly and decided to leave."

Glorified BPO with vastly overqualified hires,2019-12-12,Digital Marketing Strategist in Hyderābād,1,,- Great salary and benefits - Some truly brilliant and helpful people - Opportunity to eventually switch to a more worthwhile role in the company,"- Quintessentially Indian culture of sycophancy and hovering around certain ""popular"" figures, coupled with corporate double-speak around equity and transparency makes for a fascinating study in contradictions  - Convoluted, opaque (and therefore prone to hacking and favoritism) performance metrics combined with some toxic management leading to unchecked, ever-increasing meaningless busywork to stand out.   - ""Visibility"" in front of management, who lack all touch with the day-to-day reality of the job, is emphasized above all. This encourages cynical hustling and high school-like jockeying for popularity and recognition. Or, as Google likes to call it, ""bringing your whole self to work""  - Massive sense of entitlement flowing from the Google brand reflects in hiring and onboarding - including coerced ""voluntary"" activities for new hires and relocation and joining at almost a day's notice. Expect it to become more dysfunctional if hiring ramps up  - The famed contempt for the privacy of its consumers bleeds into norms around ""openness"" and ""sharing"" that pervade the work environment."

Awesome place - not sure I should have left ;),2010-08-05,"in London, England",5,,"The work environment and the benefits are legendary and are really as good as everyone says. The *free* food is phenomenal, although I must have put on a stone and a half in my time there! The culture is exciting, the work interesting, and you really do impact millions of people around the world. Many events and theme days make going to work fun and it's really much more than your average company. Still proud to say I worked there","An expectation that you will work all hours of the day - breakfast, lunch and dinner is provided for a reason. Not the best salary in the world, but everything else that's great about the place makes up for that. There's a bit of ""that's not out remit"" discussion between departments, which can lead to things not being picked up."
Outstanding employer image is absolutely justified!,2014-09-27,"Account Strategist in Dublin, Dublin",5,,"Benefits and perks for sure. However, its the people, the spirit, the respect and the amazing diversity that makes Google an outstanding employer. I am in the company for less than 3 months and already got an approval to learn a new language out of personal interest! And my manager does everything to support my personal and professional development, however leaves me space to settle and familiarize with the new environment.","You are in a competitive environment and suddenly you're not one of the smartest of your peers anymore (like you were in college) but are really challenged to go above and beyond to stand out. And some teams are really competitive, especially those who get performance bonus. There is a LOT to learn and it is quite overwhelming and seems a little fuzzy in the beginning, but pretty soon there is this point where the puzzle suddenly starts to make sense!"
Happy and satisfied in the first 3 years but recognition and opportunities are now limited,2011-06-17,,3,,"Pretty satisfied with some of the indirect benefits (company/team outings, onsite perks). Most peers and coworkers made work more enjoyable. Also great to work with some of the smartest people in technology.","Too many overachievers and ""type A"" personalities all fighting for the next big thing. The company has grown so much that competition is greater thus limiting advancement. Lots of very junior and inexperienced managers who were great individual contributors that got promoted to be managers. Also not much support from upper management to grow."
Strategist,2015-05-04,"in London, England",3,,"- Perks + Benefits, good compensation - Casual Working culture and still relative flat hirarchy  - Colleagues and Teams - Work cross-functionally and globally","- Strong Performance Pressure with quarterly reviews, ratings that measure performance numerically and meticulously, and the need to over-perform for three consecutive quarters to even be considered for a promotion. Can lead to very slow career progression.  - Lots of leg work and operations, often you manage chaos and company politics rather than make things happen  - Lots of launches means a lot of overtime - Very ambitious and very competitive colleagues and shift culture towards having to put in a lot of extra hours and extra effort - Lack of diversity (everyone is an over-achiever coming from similar personal and professional backgrounds, both in business and on the engineering side)"
Associate Account Strategist,2013-10-09,Associate Account Manager in Wrocław,3,,"Atmosphere: the work atmosphere is great, you have fun with your colleagues and it's up to you to build the right atmosphere in your team. Learning: you can learn a lot, especially about the products (AdWords, Analytics, YouTube) and develop your soft skills like time management, productivity, wok under stress. Responsibility: you can take several roles aside from your core job.","Stressful: everything is about metrics, how much you do, how well you do it. You are compared to your teammates when it comes to performance review and you are told if you performed better than your team, average or below the rest of your team. The core job is repetitive and if you want to work on other roles you mostly have to do it extra hours, the teams are often stretched and you'll be on the phone 6-7 hours a day."
"Great experience, but all consuming",2014-09-24,Anonymous Employee,3,,"I'll miss my team and the people the most, Google has done a great job in hiring over the years. The fast pace (for such a large company) is very exciting, and the autonomy (once you have proven yourself) is great for people who relish that. Also the values are strong and the ability to innovate and really push for new developments and advances in your role and function are really well supported","For people outside the US, increasingly becoming too US (well Valley) centric - aside from regional roles most of the interesting senior roles are based there, beware if you are in Europe or elsewhere globally. Drain of people moving there as the only means to further their careers. Also politics (as with any big company) is rife and silo's strong. Finally don't expect to have much of a life outside of the company"
Looked After,2015-05-27,"Senior Account Manager in Dublin, Dublin",3,,"Benefits are amazing: GP, Dentist, Nurse, Restaurants, Massage and Nails on site in Dublin campus.  Work space is gorgeous: open plan, colourful office plans with loads of high spec meeting rooms.  Technology: Personal technology for work, E.g. laptops and phones are top notch and upgraded regularly. Software and systems are always newest version. Culture: There is still a fairly young workforce in Dublin office with loads of bright and really interesting people with a lot to offer. A team centric culture is very much endorsed and Googlers are still happy to jump in and help where possible.  Travel: There is huge opportunity to travel and or relocate as Google has offices just about everywhere in the world.",Workload: With the culture of ambition and innovation comes high workloads.  Complexity: Organisations and internal processes can be highly complex and difficult to navigate.  Promotion: the organisation is still very flat and promotion is very competitive.

It's hard to leave as life at Google is cosy on the whole - this means not enough of those that should, do."
