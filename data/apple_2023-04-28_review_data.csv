Excellent Training & Development,2023-04-28,"Sales in Tulsa, OK",5,,"The training is intensive, you feel very prepared when you get to the sales floor. The steps of service are something you'll use daily in all areas of life and will use no matter where you go next. The management works to develop you and there is scheduled times throughout the year to touch base and work on that development. If you are mobile, your options within the company are endless! Great place for a young person to work...take the training, the development, the tuition assistance, the stocks, the insurance, etc and make the most of it!","Customers can be nuts...they care about their devices so passionately that when they don't work they are often angry, entitled and abusive."
"Challenging, Rewarding, but ZERO work/life balance. Most satisfying , most difficult and most rewarding job ever.",2014-08-28,Anonymous Employee,4,,"We work with geniuses - in every department, We create innovative products that thrill our customers and create new product categories - who else can say that?","ZERO ZERO ZERO work/life balance. Execs have been saying for YEARS that they understand and will make it better. But in actuality, it gets worse every year! It is obviously top management LIP SERVICE because if they meant it, they could fix it tomorrow. They have hundreds of BILLIONS in the bank. If they REALLY cared about employee work/life balance, they could bring aboard the right number of folks to make that issue dissolve. Sick of hearing the lies. Just don't lie about wanting to fix it, when they clearly DON'T care"
At-Home-Advisor,2015-05-13,"Home Advisor in Lakewood, CO",5,,"The position is at home. The company is AMAZING. There are limitless advancement opportunities. You work with some very cool people and the leadership cares about your development. You may get coaching but you never get battered or belittled. The pay is decent and the benefits include, 401(k) match, stock purchase options, product discounts and discounts on services across many different areas, education assistance, child care assistance, paid vacation, sick time and other time off options, health club Reimbursment or bike cost set off. You get 1.5 time for OT and it's pretty much unlimited as long as you don't exceed 12 hours in a day or 59 total in a week.",The schedule changes every 90 days and you have to bid for your shifts so you never know what you are going to get. This makes it extremely hard to plan your life to far in advance. You are also pretty much assured to work a Saturday or Sunday.
Changing the world (in a small way),2016-01-22,"Software Engineer IV in Cupertino, CA",5,,"Working at Apple means that the things you work on get into the hands of hundreds of millions of people, literally. It's a lot of pressure to get things right and drives one to do the best work of their lives. 2+ years later I'm still blown away by the talent and creativity of people I work with.","It's a lot of work, teams are usually strapped for resources and under pressure to deliver on strict timelines leading to high stress and long hours at certain times during the year."
A Company as Meticulous as Their Products!,2017-03-10,"Specialist in Tempe, AZ",5,,"Competitive Pay, Great Benefits, Amazing People, Great Work, Awesome Opportunities, Excellent Experiences, Great atmospheres in a beautiful store, no matter where you're working!",None! I had one of the best times ever at this company. Hopefully I stay to go on to corporate!
Very well run company. Excellent career growth.,2023-03-10,CAD Engineer - ICT IV,5,,Very good pay and benefits. Management genuinely appreciates good work done. They provide good compensation raises and bonuses to keep you. Leave credits to you fairly. And the stock appreciation does give you some good upside. The employee purchase plan (EPP) is good. Plus they have EPP+ which gives extra money for purchases every three years. The company buys and uses some of the best software packages from vendors and so you are enabled to do a very high quality work using the best software there is.,Very hectic work life. My group has a requirement that nobody can take more time off than 2 weeks at a stretch. But now with remote work arrangements you can work from remote geographies for up to 4 weeks a year and can combine it with vacations. This policy is generally working out well enough so far. The ESPP policy limits you to no more than 10% of your salary to be invested. No matching rewards on ESPP. But the stock appreciation and stability of the stock price probably make up for it.
Great place to work,2023-04-27,"Technical Expert in Danbury, CT",5,,Awesome environment and team. Fun to work here. Always room to grow. Fantastic management team. Great goals and atmosphere.,"It’s still retail at the end of the day. Weekends are mostly always needed, and of course, very busy."
Worst Job Experience EVER !,2023-04-24,"Technical Specialist in Brooklyn, NY",2,,"The pros were the endless resources on the peoples page for all apple employees, learning how to repair technology and troubleshoot infront of customers, and transportation reimbursements. The starting pay in NY for the technical specialist role $22.50 and goes up every 6 months, by the time I resigned I was getting paid $25.75","juvenile working environment, racist managers, retaliation in the work place from managers against employees, multiple sexual harassment investigations against senior managers in the store. A completely awful environment, met with alot of uncomfortable situations."
Apple Retail Store,2023-04-19,"Sales Specialist in Portland, OR",4,,Apple was a surprisingly great company to work for. They offer part-time employees benefits and there are a lot of resources available. The products kind of sell themselves and 90% of the customers you interact with in the store are pleasant.,"No commission. This is a huge one. Apple says it would ruin the culture but I don't believe that. You could divvy up a tiny percentage of total store sales and disperse that evenly throughout every employee in the store. There's a huge push to sell Apple Care and getting customers linked up with the Apple Business Team. Very limited amount of roles within the store and despite what you are told, the path to Corporate is likely 3-5 years no matter how awesome you are. No time off during launch season and the holidays. Working from September through the end of the year was an awful whirlwind. The pay is pretty low. This would be a great job for someone who just graduated High School but for other people with more years of experience in the workforce it's kind of painful."

Additionally, many employees report a positive work-life balance and a supportive and collaborative work environment.","Some potential cons of working at Apple include a competitive and fast-paced work environment, which can be stressful for some employees. Additionally, there may be a high expectation for secrecy and confidentiality, which can make it difficult to share information or collaborate with others outside the company. Some former employees also reported feeling micromanaged or having limited autonomy in their work. Additionally, some employees may find the company culture to be exclusive or insular, and may not feel that they fit in with the company's values and way of working."

Painful but worth it,2022-11-29,"AppleCare Team Manager in Sacramento, CA",3,,- The training provided to leadership will prepare you to work anywhere in CA - You are pushed to your potential - The amazing relationships built with direct reports - Being ahead of the tech if you are a huge Apple fan,- Lack of empathy at times from top down Sr. Leaders - Having to protect your direct reports from people looking to blame others - Performing well and ethically requires far more then 40 hr weeks - It's the only place more political then the Whitehouse - Ego prevents real growth of internal organizations and strongly impacts front line employees

Awesome Place of work.,2023-03-13,Applecare At Home Advisor,5,,"Awesome experience, Apple is hands down the best company to work for!","No Cons really, I truly enjoy working for Apple!"
Company genuinely cares about you!,2014-09-10,"Family Room Specialist in Stamford, CT",5,,"- Great benefits  - great work environment - great salary (especially for retail) - lots of peer support - lots of management support - lots of learning experiences and resources - opportunity for advancement - opportunities for ""career experiences"" in corporate roles, for retail staff (underutilized, apparently. go for it!) - you become really good friends with your peer group, or maybe even family! - Amazing sense of belonging and community - great stepping stone to new career, if that is your choice","- Too much ""drinking the kool aid"". WAY too much. I hope this is an apt metaphor: Imagine you have an 8oz cup in your hand. They pour a 64oz pitcher of Kool-Aid into your 8oz. cup. Then they pour a pitcher of sugar into the same cup. You get diabetes. The amount of company propaganda is absolutely astounding and excessive to point of being absolutely ridiculous, wherein you feel like a caricature of yourself wearing this blue shirt. This is coming from me, a lifelong Apple fan since 1987 (the year I started using computers). - FAR too much bashing of anything that isn't Apple. Apple has now decided as a company, to compare itself to Samsung and Google, etc etc. It used to decide not to compare itself to anybody. This shows everywhere from development to retail attitudes. - Willing isolation from and ignorance of the rest of the world of technology. Apple exists in a bubble, and those within the bubble are blissfully unaware that any other technology is relevant and useful. I heard one employee say that Microsoft Office is going the way of the dinosaurs. Nobody called him out on this. What dream world is he living in???? Isn't it better to learn Apple's technology in a way that helps it workably coexist with other technology? This is equally as important as learning the Apple ecosystem, which, yes, in itself is amazing. - Training is too general, not specific enough to help sharpen one's technical skill set on a consistent basis. - No ongoing training program to keep your technical skills sharp and up to date. Instead, they offer ""Pathways"", which is meant to improve your social skills. Great! But isn't that why they hired us to begin with? You have to search Apple's technical reporting system for relevant known issues, which is fine but if you don't (and a lot of techs don't) you usually find out what those are when a customer has a problem and you don't know the answer. One person who happened to look at iDesk might know the answer, but if they're not available, you may end up giving the customer the wrong solution. The signal to noise ratio of important, specific information is a total mess. - ""I can't believe they re-arranged the lockers. I'm thinking about quitting now."" Everyone joins in agreement. Really, guys? C'mon. Again, as I mentioned in my point about the Apple ""bubble"", the perception of reality can be largely distorted. Management has to work REALLY REALLY hard to bend over backwards for every little thing. So how much energy do they have left over to make sure their techs are up to date, or that sales staff knows their specs and has good ways of explaining tech to non-tech people? Apple is very big on managing expectations for customers (great, actually!) but could do a lot better to manage expectations for employees. Maybe this would improve management's time and ability to fix some more important issues. - Far too many points of contact for customers. A customer may end up talking to between 4 and 8 different people who may end up telling them lots of conflicting things. Either communication needs to improve in the store or the number of contact points needs to decrease somehow."
Things could be better at Apple,2023-01-09,Senior Technical Advisor,3,,Great benefits Great environment when you first get to the company but quickly burn out. 2023 Apple started offering Coursera training for all employees free.,There is a disconnection with the higher ups and the folks in the front line.

"Good Company Values, Not the Best Follow Through",2022-10-02,"Operations Specialist in New York, NY",3,,"The company stands for a lot of great things - helping the environment, giving opportunities to underprivileged communities across the country, and more. The team of peers can be very tight knit and it is a joy to see the people you work alongside every day, in spite of the lack of leadership and the abundance of customer service issues.","Leadership (so I hear across several stores) is sub-par. I have experienced colleagues mistreated more times than I can count. In retail, we are regularly subjected to harassment and abuse from customers with little to no support from leadership. There is no commission, and no real opportunity to negotiate pay. For a company worth almost $3 trillion, we should be paid much more, especially in flagship locations in NYC."

Temporary Job At Best,2022-05-24,Operations Associate,3,,The pay is just enough to keep you from leaving. Clean environment. Plenty of training in your respective role (if requested). The employee stock purchase program (ESPP) is the primary reason to stay employed.,"No advancement opportunities within retail. If you become a genius there is a chance to land a corporate role, but the cost of living offsets the financial reasoning to move. Many associates complain that they were working themselves to the bone but saving less than they did when in retail. Managers are absolutely oblivious to their staff; self absorbed with their ambitions ferociously guided by their own career ambitions. The management is daft, insincere, unhelpful in any regard, and absolutely metrics obsessed. They only want to know about metrics os they have something to say to senior leaders to make themselves seem intelligent/productive, when in reality they just hide in the managers office throughout their shifts shifting all of their work onto Leads and other team members. There is no access to sunlight within the building and the air quality is rancid due to all of the people being isolated within the store (no windows, only one large entry door where guests enter). Seniority puts you at a higher risk of termination because Management wants to save on payroll. Managers have no respect for individual associates; only team metrics. Company culture is dissolving faster than that raccoon trying to wash his cotton candy."

Once upon a time this place was ran by a bunch of old nepotism Santa Cruz yokels in a mid life crisis walking around in button up Hawaiian shirts, bragging about their Italian loafers, propeller pilot flying since Ancient Rome, and constantly hitting on younger colleagues.

For example, one year I won an award for top performance and only got a 2% raise.  - They’re trying to get advisors who have always worked from home into the office - No options for advancement besides management. They even paid thousands of dollars for my education but provided no opportunities to use my degree.  - Arbitrary quotas for performance reviews. Eg. At least X number of employees have to receive “needs improvement” ratings, regardless of actual performance.  - Apple doesn’t care about customers abusing advisors. You’ll be treated horribly and then blamed for it. - They’ll pay you extra for working on holidays, but good luck actually getting a holiday off work."

This is not an exaggeration. People will email well beyond appropriate business hours, ping, text, email like they text. Weekend and late night work is expected.   - Ridiculous overtime at no additional comp for salaried employees; this is “meeting expectations”. I’ve never been thanked or apologized to when interrupted on a Sunday afternoon. I have not had a weekend in a month. I did not get Memorial Day off, I had to skip Mother’s Day, I already know I will be expected to work Labor Day. What is the price of your time and life?  - Most execs and leads are men. My team is most female, on the ground level, while all leads are men.  I came from Google. It was an extremely tough decision to make. The creative is stronger here; there is no arguing that. That’s why I came. In comparison to Google, who also has peak moments of large work volume, my experience has been that Apple does not consider the cost and considerations of pushing for more work. The compensation isn’t as comparable to Google. The benefits are definitely not. The culture is teetering toxic. Essentially, on all other levels aside from creative and cool co-workers, I’d recco Google hands down."

If your views and goals don't match their financial agenda, you'll be ""volentold"" to develop yourself towards those goals. (they were always trade in related because it affects their bonus) - Horrible pay (most raises for a $2T company showing 1-3% annually with them leading ""this is all we could get you"" while still being underpaid by more than 10% compared to others) - Needed competitive salary, but they would never do it - Customers belittle you almost as much as management at times - Overworked; never given time to take a breather. If you aren't producing the numbers they want you to produce, they'll force you to ""work"" on it. - Managers can care less about the best resolution for a customer and employee; will only give their opinion which is always to purchase a new computer because it affects their paychecks."

Constantly changing expectations. Lack of support. Lack of attention to remote employee health. Apple hires 3rd party vendors to cover its frontline incoming customer calls. These vendors are not full Apple staff and thus aren't fully trained. Their interactions with customers typically end up with the caller having incorrect or partial information that either doesn't solve the problem or makes it worse. Then, the customer gets escalated to senior support and at that point they're irate. Apple seems cool, but not in the customer service department. AT ALL."

My immediate reporting manager was amazing as was my store manager/HR. Most of the time sales were easy.","INADEQUATE TRAINING. I was someone who started without an abundance of tech knowledge. My team taught me something new every day, all day. Normally a good thing but not great when the store is swamped (which frequently happens) and you're essentially on your own. Still retail, Same challenges with any other retail position: Unrealistic hours (cant exactly be helped. Weekends and nights), Not enough Pay to scrape by (On the higher side of retail though.) ""Unspoken"" sales/business intro/apple accessory + service quotas. Zero incentive to achieve a top position in any previously mentioned categories, aside from recognition. Any advancement WILL require some outside education. Apple/ Store sponsorship does exist to some varying degree. Apple corporate and Apple retail are two ENTIRELY different entities. Just because an employee enters the Apple ""eco-system"" at a base level doesn't mean that the employee may have a better chance of securing a corporate career, even with an adequate curriculum vitae and professional experience. Experiences seem like more of a way to ""tease"" employees rather than show a glimpse of a future career."

Advancement is RARELY based on merit and experience. The constant drive for new talent is present in all positions so it is FAR more likely that someone from outside the org will end up your boss than someone whose been promoted. Or it will be someone internal but was transferred from another department. Individual achievements are not recognized. Your success is Apple’s success so know that you are a small cog in a big machine that won’t miss you when you leave. Apple will engulf every aspect of your life. More relatives will call you asking for help with their products than relatives would call you if you won the lottery.

"Great company overall, Retail could use some management help",2016-12-14,"Retail - Expert in South Portland, ME",5,,"It is amazing to work for one of the biggest companies in technology history. Retail can provide you with hundreds of different opportunities for going corporate. You can even get sponsored to go and work for corporate, and they will pay for you to live at a corporate location and work for them there. This is a company that provides growth on many levels for internal employees and has wonderful benefits. Even for part-timers, Apple provides paid leave for family needs, and has vision, dental, and great healthcare. They offer 401k and stock options, as well as donating to any nonprofit you may volunteer for. Apple is fantastic to work for.","The retail management is really rough for the most part. They bring in people from other retail companies, not realizing that none of these people know what our day to day jobs are. We have to explain technology to customers daily, and yet our management knows barely anything about technology. They are simply the mouth puppets of whoever is running the ""corporate values"" side of Retail. At Corporate, there is nothing like this, but in Retail they discuss ""competencies"" and more to sound like their boring management means something. They don't care about development for each employee, they just care about their salary and making sure customers don't get upset. There are a few managers who get it, but not enough to make a difference. Apple really needs to change the way they pick their retail managers."

Proud to work here,2013-10-22,"Software Engineering Manager in Cupertino, CA",3,,"You may get to work on the number one feature, on the number one product, from the number one company in the world. Processes in place for risk management are excellent. Everyone shares a common goal to make the best products for the consumer, and it shows in most every conversation you have. Plenty of smart people to learn from. All your friends and family know about your company and the products you helped create.","- Some of the higher-ups are just Apple dinosaurs who have been promoted over time for what appears to be loyalty and relationships alone. Quite a few don't have the capability to understand what they are managing and regularly make poor decisions. Engineering is the only profession I know of where this disconnect can be so vast... ever heard of a chief of staff at a hospital who wasn't a physician? - Managers can manage with an iron fist due to the legacy of Steve Jobs and for some, he the only management role model they have. Works if you are him and CEO, not so much if you're director level. Lately this is being improved upon with frequent re-orgs.  - People keep saying how everyone is an ""A"" player, but this isn't really true. Have worked with smarter people elsewhere.  - No opportunity to publicly discuss your work, or get involved with academic research - Secrecy can get in the way"
Best Retail Job But It's Still Just a Retail Job,2014-04-06,"Family Room Specialist in Glendale, CA",4,,"Plenty of career development opportunities and support. Dedicated time allocated each month for self-guided training. Benefits are good; many healthcare options, matched 401k contributions, discounted stock options, etc. Discounts available on Apple and 3rd party products. Great managers and co-workers (depends on store though). Usually a very positive atmosphere.","It's a retail job with retail hours and slightly above average retail pay. Discounts aren't particularly deep and Apple makes a tidy profit from its own employees' purchases. Compensation doesn't match the skillset and knowledge required. FRS role is a blend of Genius and Creative whilst getting paid the same as a part-time entry-level Specialist. Specialists who are routinely selling $100k+ of goods per quarter will never earn even $40k annually. You definitely wont be able to afford a mortgage. You'll probably be grateful to afford rent within 5 miles of an Apple store. Just thinking about it will ruin your day. Apple is no longer allowing employees to specify a preferred weekend day off, so you get to pick a day off Mon-Thurs and hope you don't work all weekend. You're dealing with the public all day, some of whom have no sense of responsibility (or sense at all).  Too many people fighting for too few higher-paid positions."

My boss is cool. Most aren't.,2009-04-05,"Software Engineer IV in Cupertino, CA",4,,"Working for Apple can be something you take pride in - I write software that my whole family (and millions of other people) get to see and use every day. My work is usually interesting, and I'm mostly surrounded by very smart people.  My manager is not typical - he is respectful of my life outside of work. My work schedule is very flexible thanks to that. I'm always able to take vacations, and I'm able to telecommute once a week, sometimes twice if I need to. I haven't come into the office on the weekend at all during the last 4-5 years.  Since 2007-2008, our cafeteria is awesome. It really sucked before that. The burrito bar kicks ass now. Cafeteria food costs $$$ - it's not free.","Many departments, and their VP's, directors, and managers have unrealistic expectations of their employees. Particularly on the hardware engineering side of Infinite Loop (buildings 5 and 6), people get driven very hard and are regularly expected to work weekends.   I've witnessed age discrimination. On multiple occasions, co-workers over 50 were laid off without warning. I assume this is a routine pruning to let go the people with the highest salaries, but it always feels kinda wrong to me. My department does regular layoffs, maybe 8-10 people get dropped every 2 years. At the same time, we're always hiring. Our use of layoffs seems like a disingenuous (disingenuous since we're hiring simultaneously) way to drop poor performers."

Also After you have worked in Apple Retail every one seems to go on and find amazing jobs after they quit or leave.,"This is retail! I was Working in the Marina. This place was a play found for the rich! You don't work on commission but your still measured though KPI every day. They act like you and the store are sharing the same destiny but its just more of the Kool Aid that they feed you while your there. The employee discount is just buying items tax free. You can't move up unless your a Genius then you might have the chance to go to corporate.   You expected to do things that have nothing to do with the job. Imagine trying to teach an 80 year old man how to use his computer.   Apple corporate Employees are some of the shittiest most entitled people you'll ever meet. They will tell there friends not to buy protection plans! And there just condescending with how they treat you, ""Oh, you consider yourself and Apple employee.""

Excellent benefits package as well as ""staying healthy"" competitive challenges. I did learn how NOT to mentor/manage others.","Truly expected to lay ones life down for the good of the company. Long hours with high (sometimes unreasonable) expectations. There is no life outside of Apple. Although it tries to represent itself as a big company with a small business approach, the longer I was there the more I realized how much it is a huge corporate entity and I was just a number. Hard to get promoted within the company unless one is driven toward corporate. Managers, Store Manager, and General Manager have their own approaches and agendas. Be ready for many management changes, including upper such as Store and General. With so much turn-around and transfers, it becomes harder and harder to feel complacent (of which is a word meaning ""death"" in the eyes of Apple)."

They give no financial assistance with this major purchase.  -Must pay for your work phone and internet service.

Apple Inc. leads the pack in retail employee satisfaction.,2008-05-15,"Concierge in Corte Madera, CA",4,,"This is really the place where doors open, but Apple also pushes it's employees to take the steps through those doors by applying for higher-ranking positions within the company. The people who work at Apple Retail is enough to want to work there regardless of what exact job one might have. The employees are friendly, diverse (on many different levels) and intelligent. Retail is usually never is exciting, but at Apple Retail, it is. Apple knows its people and the people (both customers and employees) know Apple. One who works at Apple Retail feels local, not national.","The job can be quite rewarding, but I do find that many employees are having difficult balancing work time and other time. I myself have been in a few situations where the calendar for my work-schedule overrides my life schedule, and that shouldn't happen. Some employees often look towards others to share shifts, but everything usually works out in the end."
"If you are considering a field sales job, do your homework.",2009-02-28,Account Executive,2,,"This post relates only to corporate sales, not Apple stores, and not working for Apple Corporate in Cupertino.  As an account executive, the group (e.g. Higher Education, K-12, Corporate or Channel) you work for makes a huge difference. The products are great, and the benefits are great. Customers love the products, and hence generally want to work with you. It's a company you can take pride in at the high level.","Most of the sales managers have been in their jobs for 10-20 inside Apple. My manager was promoted despite having no experience working outside of Apple for the last 20 years. The ""good old boy"" network was in full swing. There was zero tolerance for ""out of the Apple box"" approaches business development, which is highly ironic for a company known for innovation.  Our team brought proven concepts borrowed from other industries, with documented ROI, yet every attempt to improve processes was crushed by people who had been in their jobs far too long. To make things worse, very poor performance is tolerated if the employee is a manager ""favorite"", while top performers suffered. Many members of our group went for several years without a performance review, which then eliminated their chances for salary increases and promotion."

Most coworkers are on the same wavelength as you, so it's usually pretty easy to get a long with people. Higher up in the chain, it appears that the top level of management really does listen to employee concerns and they make attempts to address problems. (Unfortunately this is usually botched by local level management). Overall though, it's a great day job, but not something I want to do for the rest of my life.","Retail hours (including weekends and holidays), the occasional obnoxious customer, absolutely no transparency from management, expectations of work don't match the pay rate, promotions are based on manager preference rather than job performance, additional responsibilities without pay raises are given to people all the time so they get burnt out, summers and holidays are almost unbearably busy  At my location specifically, I'm not a big fan of my management. I think they're mostly inept. This doesn't reflect on the company as a whole, but it's the main reason I'm somewhat dissatisfied here. Beyond my local and market managers, it at least appears that there are some competent people, but then again we've never actually met them, either."

Often times it felt as if leadership just wanted us to meet metrics so that they could get their bonuses at the end of the year.  - The worst work-life balance I have ever experienced -- had a multitude of time-off requests denied (that were submitted months in advance) and was also hassled by management for not meeting ""the needs of the business"" - Micro-management -- what is the point of telling your employees to assume positive intent and have liberties with the customer interaction if the management is constantly overbearing and questioning a majority of your decisions anyway - No chance for career growth. There is a lot of bait and switch with Apple Retail. Many employees are misled to believe that they will eventually end up at Apple Corporate. There is nearly no career growth to begin with, most pay increases are marginal and promotions in Apple Retail are lateral. A lot of politics play into promotions, the innovators are seldom recognized."

You just have to sit on the phone and let the customer verbally abuse you.  -They do not train enough in higher positions. When you ask for help they promise you they will get help but it never happens. -When you get really sick you are forced to take a medical leave and they won't work with your schedule.  -They will not adjust your schedule for kids, school or anything unless you jump through hoops to get a doctors note for medical reasons. -They get really aggressive when your scores are perfect even if it is just a bad month.  - Bathroom breaks are saved for during your 15 min break or lunch break. Hold it otherwise.  -If you find that you can not handle a promotional roll they will not let you move back to an older position. They tell you to stick with it or quit."

Great products, and for a retail store, best in the world.","That said, your work / life balance will be absolutely terrible. Managers are demanded all the time, and its on you to make sure a roll out, launch, or initiative succeeds. Often times, a day off is a joke, with plenty of emails and phone calls for follow up or other things of the sort. Apple controls communications, so often times, you're making special trips to work to do things, and due to the secretive nature of the company, you're often given very little lead time to get things in place. Rearranged schedules are the norm. PTO is a pain in the ass to schedule. Tough to see the ""next move"" once you've reached management, the limited number of stores is also a built-in challenge to that."

I knew a few employee who were overly qualified to work at an apple store and worked their for years praying they would get a promotion in the end they were terminate for silly reasons, However they promote people that had no working knowledge of computers and had been in the store less time. Oh and they talk about this thing called ""fearless feed back"", however, don't get it twist.. if you decide that you need to talk to your manager about something important and need help you will get burned for it. The store in the falls in notorious for firing the smartest people and keeping the dumbest ones because they are drones. The employees that make it are the ones that aren't going to school and will work retail till they are 60. Oh and they just recently started giving part-timers insurance benefits.

Another thing Apple did great was made sure their employee's were taken care of with benefits.,"I did not like that if you didn't play the game you couldn't move up. The days of hard work shows off your skills and should determine your advancement are over. Its all about ""look at me"" or ""look what I did"". If you kiss butt and showed off how amazing you think you were then you were rewarded. I did not like this aspect. They also had a policy about Open Feed Back. Which only went one way.

The peer group is great at teaching and encouraging new technology. Working alongside talented, smart people makes you want to better yourself. Helping customers solve problems is rewarding.","Retail middle management. The cultural vision of the CEO and Retail president stops at the regional level. Everything below that is just like every other retailer. Favoritism, lack of compassionate leadership, inept HR and non-inspirational leadership is rampant. They take internal employee surveys and have some of the worst scores yet no one looks at middle management. CEO pushes his political agenda via email and those who don't like it stay quiet because of the money they make. HR makes up things as they go. There's no consistent messaging and one person can be written up for something and another can be passed over. I'm surprised there's not been more lawsuits. Sadly even while I was with Apple retail I steered previous peers away from interviewing. I didn't want them to say I didn't tell them."
Can be a good company to work for if you don’t expect to ever go anywhere with the company.,2019-08-31,"Anonymous Employee in Washington, DC",1,,"Good benefits, especially for college students.","Apple treats its employees as easily replaceable commodities. Don’t expect any loyalty from the company even after working there for over a decade. In fact, they’d rather treat new employees better and the seasoned employees, because new employees are usually still drinking the Apple Kook-aid and are still optimistic about the future. Don’t trust HR. Employees don’t realize that HR has a legal obligation to Apple and it’s stakeholders to protect the company and side with the company on employee issues. They are NOT looking out of the employee’s best interest. That is not their job, but they would like you to think they are. Do not confide any confidential information with. They will turn on you and defend Apple rather than admit wrong doing by the company and risk a lawsuit from an employee. I’ve seen many employees forced out of the company because HR turned on them and they became a liability. Apple makes it nearly impossible to advance in your career and get a decent raise. To make matters worse, if you’ve been at the company for a long time, newer, less experience employees will probably be making more money than you, because Apple doesn’t value employee retention."

Tim Cook should be ashamed and should take that picture of King down because it is disgraceful how exclusionary Apple is. And there are just too many managers, I mean micromanagers.

Better for the short term,2017-04-07,"Technical Specialist in Los Angeles, CA",2,,Great benefits. I've had some really great people skills instilled in me. I'm not naturally tech savvy so working at apple keeps me up to date.,"The idea of the culture Apple wants in the retail environment is such a good one. Unfortunately, it doesn't get carried out very often. Most of the tenured people there hate their job but have a hard time moving on to another job with equal or better pay and benefits. Retail is retail and if you work at the Genius Bar (like I do) you will most likely encounter several angry, rude, mean, unreasonable and entitled acting people. They will suck all the apple juice right out of you and you will be exhausted and burnt out and depressed. If you are an empath (again, like me) you will be very good at your job but over time, it will be hard on you and you won't even recognize yourself if you don't get out before the negative energy eats your soul."

"I remember when it was ""cool"" to work for ? and employees were actually knowledgeable...",2009-08-07,"in New York, NY",2,,"excellent $$$$, usually some free software. you get to wear your own clothes (except for the t-shirt and lanyard they make you wear.)","The place went from being a very lax work environment that cared about it's employees to a very much numbers and sales oriented operation that made employees cut-throat against one another. got rid of bonuses, and barely gave any free iPods or iphone away. I remember the days of bonuses, lots of free iPods, and even a free iPhone.  It's sad when it's employees can't even afford to own the products their selling.  Also, ? used to have a more rigid hiring process, now they'll pretty much take you off the street even if you don't know what a computer is.  Kind of a sexist, homophobic, racist environment to work in at times."
The best ever,2011-10-25,"Treasury Accountant in Austin, TX",5,,"I've been with Apple for 27+ years now, and I've seen them go thru a lot of changes. Apple cares about their employees like I have never heard of any other company. Fighting Cancer and can't come to work. Then they brought the work home to them. Have bad eye sight then they got him a much larger screen with big lettering. Want a degree Apple will help you and allow you to meet the needs of your schedule. I have always had great managers who would always be there for me if I needed help. I couldn't imagine working anywhere else.",The only thing I could say in this department would be that sometimes the communacation isn't there all the time. When working on something new you need to look at the trail all the way to the end to see who it all effects.
Concerned about the direction Apple is headed in.,2013-03-15,"Senior Advisor in Atlanta, GA",4,,Work from home opportunities and some schedule choice provide some flexibility. Apple is best company I have worked for overall in terms of technology and support apparatus.,"Apple seems to be losing some of the qualities of what made it great. First, the pay does not measure up to the work. I came in 2010 and felt like I was a few years too late as Apple became hugely popular with release of new iPhone and the iPad some of the magic and personality seems to have left. Also the loss of Jobs may be a major underlying factor."
Great experience and preparation for upward movement in the technology field.,2013-10-05,"Business Specialist in Austin, TX",4,,"There is a great culture within the retail environment - awesome people with a common goal to impact customers' lives. I felt very supported by leadership, and that I was a valued member of the team. Having Apple on your résumé says a lot to potential employers as well!","The compensation versus the amount of work that is required does not encourage lasting employment. Once you've moved as high up as you can (short of a management position), there's not a lot of opportunities to develop yourself and do something new. Most Apple corporate jobs require a lot of prior experience that cannot be obtained in a retail store. The hours are also rough, but that's an unavoidable aspect of working in a mall."
"Overall, a pretty good place. Some really great people are here!",2014-04-07,"Software Engineer in Cupertino, CA",3,,"Worked here for a few years. From what I heard, things seem to be pretty team-dependent. I ended up really loving my team, however. And, I always had awesome, awesome, awesome managers that I truly love. I never had to deal with politics here (although, again, team dependent). Benefits were pretty good, and I was able to balance work/life pretty well.","I was a little unsatisfied with the work. I didn't really feel challenged. Additionally - and I realize this is quite petty - but hearing about the free and delicious food and on-site perks at Google didn't help. There is quite a lack of frivolous perks that you have at other tech companies. On a more serious note, the company culture doesn't seem very collaborative. I didn't really feel like i was part of anything big ever, or part of a bigger team than my own."
"Great People, unforgiving Polices",2014-09-26,"Anonymous Employee in Santa Monica, CA",4,,"The support of the Management and trainers is out standing, the people you work with are top notch.","Their attendance policy is very unforgiving, if you are more than a minute or two late to clock in you get a point that stays on your record for a year. Get 3 of those in a year and you can no longer transfer to opening at other stores (which I was planning on to solve some traffic issues that was making it hard to be to work on time). Get another point beyond that 3rd and you are fired."
"Overall, worth it.",2014-10-06,"Specialist in Albany, NY",4,,"Co-workers were by and large the greatest aspect of working for Apple. They do a great job of hiring awesome, intelligent, hard-working individuals. Also just a great environment if you like helping people but don't mind the occasional tough cookie who is hell-bent on giving you a hard time. Most customers are extremely grateful for your knowledge and help.","It can be tough to move to different positions. Sometimes it felt like there were manager favorites that would get all the opportunities to move around. When the store is busy, it can be chaotic and stressful working with customers you want to give your all but have the eyes of many waiting customers staring laser beams into your soul."
At Home Advisor,2017-07-01,"At Home Advisor in Austin, TX",1,,Great Pay! No Commute! Great Benefits  And it stops right there!,"Micromanagement to the point of irritation. Managers who are not knowledgeable. Constant rude customers who swear, demean, and yell at you on almost every call. Dealing with customer who have valid reasons for being upset due to subpar products and software, and having to pretend that the customer is wrong.  Shift bids every 2 months which are based on CSATs and other unattainable metrics. Working with contract employees who have had little to no training. Not allowing customers to access their own information due to some false sense of security. I would not recommend this job to anyone who wants to have work-life balance, pride in the company they work for, a support team, or a sense of self-respect at the end of the day. I am in the Pre-management program and cannot wait to change things at Apple for the better."

Customer base is high maintenance and job is very stressful at the bottom. Pay seems to start high, but levels off. No upward mobility. I've been sworn at, physically threatened, and personally attacked, no management to back up. HR helpline is a joke, they are friends with the management that they are supposed to be holding accountable. You're not allowed to feel anything but ""profound positivity"". Get in at the job you want, upwards mobility is almost non-existent. Management has a ""hands off"" approach. No accountability, hidden behind a term called ""fearless feedback"". You are to hold your peers accountable. Your management team will not."
"Good Benefits, Stressful Work Environment",2018-07-27,Tech Support Advisor,2,,"Great medical, dental, vision coverage plus access to workout gym and wellness center depending on where you live/work.","Very stressful work environment. I was working in essentially a call center, they treated us like an ""expense"" since we were not a very profitable part of the company. Tons of micro-management on every facet of our job performance and whenever there was a performance issue or if they thought you did something wrong, there was always the assumption of guilt unless proven innocent.  The people in general can be very friendly, but management seems to have a distorted view of how things work in ""the trenches"" (when taking incoming calls) and it leads to unrealistic expectations being set all the time."
Solid Gig For Whatever Your Goals May Be,2019-08-19,"Technical Specialist in Chicago, IL",5,,"Great Pay Your ability to interview and people skills WILL improve Only place I can recall gives part timers full benefits  Solid discounts on Apple products and even deeper ones on Apple supported retailers.

For me personally, I was able to work part time hours and comfortably live whilst going to school.","Regardless of you being good at solving customer problems, if you don’t meet perceived metric requirements, there’s not a lot of upward mobility  Your availability being approved oftentimes than not hinges on whether scheduling team likes you or not  Passive aggressive management sometimes is a major detriment to morale"
A discussion of all things Apple,2009-01-10,"Business Partner in Jackson, MS",4,,"Apple provides a unique work environment in that most coworkers are enthusiastic about the products directly relates to a great customer experience. In my years there I have found that Apple looks out for customers first, unlike most retail chains. They are dedicated to the consumer and dedicated to employees. Management does their best to accommodate all people from all walks of life. You are allowed to express your individuality within the walls of Apple","When looking to get promoted there are a lot of qualified applicants from within, not to mention the outside. Highly competitive for advancement. Other downsides include the air secrecy around product releases and what not. While I understand Apple's desire to create a marketing buzz, as employees, we are immediately bombarded with questions about new products the moment they are announced when we in fact have no prior knowledge of them."
A great job for young workers,2010-08-11,"in Cupertino, CA",4,,"Beautiful campus, cool products, smart co-workers. It's a fun company to be associated with. Your friends will be jealous (and also ask you to buy products using your employee discount).","As Apple continues to do better as a company, they also cut back on employee benefits. The employees with lots of stock keep getting richer, while the rest work too much overtime for average compensation compared to other companies. Healthcare costs are passed on to the employees, so benefits that were once the best in the valley pay for much less now.  Apple quietly gets rid of older, more expensive workers, and replaces them with the recent college grads who are willing to work more hours for lower pay. If you are young, it's a fun place to work a lot of hours and it looks great on your resume. But don't plan to stay there too long, unless you get lots of stock."

Everyone is interesting and talented. Don't care about your gpa or school all about how well you interview.,The couches get cold since they are made out of aluminum. The reviews are not frequent enough and therefore when you get feedback it can be a surprise.

Amazing executive team wicked smart with hearts in the right place.  Benefits second to none.",Has become a huge company that has lost it's former cult-like culture.

I came into it with alot of Apple product experience, so there was very little learning curve. Some people who work there don't even own an Apple product, it's harder for them to learn everything but they still can do it and I've seen some very successful Apple employees who started out with zero Apple experience."
A Life-changing Experience,2017-11-17,"Family Room Specialist in Las Vegas, NV",5,,"Working at Apple retail has been a life-changing experience. The demand for excellence at Apple made every day a challenge — as well as an opportunity to grow. I was expecting the drive for excellence, but I was surprised to discover just how human and humane 'Apple DNA' is in regards to accepting mistakes and human frailties.  Apple doesn't expect any employee to be perfect, but rather they expect employees to recognize and acknowledge opportunities to improve, and to grow from those experiences. What they do expect of you as an employee is that you show up to work alert, aware, and engaged in your mission. It's definitely not a environment where you can expect to just 'phone it in' metaphorically speaking.  In my 10+ year career at various Apple Stores I had numerous opportunities to act as a Mentor, facilitating new employee training and onboarding. I would always tell my new employees this: You won't lose your job for making mistakes — not if you apply yourself to acknowledging the opportunity it presents, and grow from it. In fact, I witnessed countless instances that make me believe that Apple values our ability to grow from our mistakes far more than they value our infallibility. I think most of those in leadership positions at Apple believe that if you never make any mistakes then you're probably not trying hard enough.  Yes, you do have to consistently be at the top of your game to have a successful career at Apple, but if you show up everyday ready to do the best work of your life, it's hard not to find yourself genuinely appreciated and rewarded through your efforts.","Working at Apple retail is an extremely high-pressure experience. The demand for service is non-stop. Apple Stores are always busy. Customers would frequently ask me, ""When aren't you this busy?"" My standard humorous response was, ""When we're closed!"" I'd say it with a wink and a smile, but it was essentially the truth!  Out of a 10+ year career at various Apple Stores, I spent about four years as a mobile-device certified technician, (a Family Room Specialist, or FRS for short). Eventually, the daily pressure of dealing with customers' issues with their Apple technology got to be too stressful for me, and I needed to take a medical leave. My store's leadership was very helpful and supportive of me throughout this period, and when I returned even allowed me to transfer to a less stressful sales position (a Specialist in Apple's terminology) without any negative consequences. I was able to speak openly with my coworkers about my anxiety attacks, and never felt unsafe doing so."

Customers are very nice compared to other call centers. Lots of perks.,It's still a phone tech support job and that is still awful even at Apple. In fact it might be worse because management does not have your back and is often reactionary to minor statistical fluctuations that don't persist over a day or so. Management often seems unfamiliar with the process of how we do our job and is a source of misinformation.

Rude customers. Mentally exhausting and repetitive day to day. Micro managed and management knit picky on attendance and numbers. Promotions seem very political so be on your managers good side and submit the progress journal monthly even when not asked to in order to be considered. You are told in training that you have power to make your own decisions to make the customer happy, and that a great leadership quality is asking for forgiveness rather than permission, however I’ve seen many times where managers step on your toes when you want to do something for the customer and the fight with you because they don’t want to.

It also seems like the management isn't hired from the same quality of employees. Unilaterally, I watched all the amazing managers leave our store for better jobs.   That's what happens here. If you're good at your job and you care about what you do, management will wring you for all you're worth until you're nothing but a desiccated husk. The smart ones will leave before that happens.  The ones that succeed here are the ones who will ""drink the koolaid"" or, as we put it, ""the Apple juice"" - free thinkers need not apply."

They are looking for drones and trying to build an empire without considering others or the business ramifications. If you have an opinion that doesn't match theirs then you are out. These employees acquired the top engineering talent needed to make Apple products successful with great personal sacrifice; working an obscene amount of hours.

"Great at first, but the culture took a nose dive over the years",2013-03-12,"AppleCare Manager in Austin, TX",3,,"- At least when I first started, the culture was amazing.

You'll want to jump off a cliff for them. - The onsite benefits are pretty rocking. Cafeteria, very nice gym, lovely campus, onsite Toastmasters group (at least while I was there), various employee organizations and clubs, etc. - There's a lot of growth, so if you can play the politics game, you have a bright future ahead of you","As I continued on in my career at Apple, the company grew up and became more corporate. What does that mean? Fewer people got promoted from within (preferring instead to get people form the outside, people with MBAs, etc.) - As good as the benefits are, there were some serious lacks (example: No paternity leave, no paid leave for adoption, no sabbaticals, etc.) - Very few managers (and certainly almost no upper managers) care about the customer. They care about the number, but not about the actual customer. - The pay is okay at best. They brag that they're solidly average. This seems counterintuitive for one of the richest companies in the world. Value your human capital. - You do have to play politics. Which often translates to keeping your mouth shut. Anger the wrong person and you may as well quit because your career there is over. - A lot of the skills they teach aren't transferrable. Instead of certifying people in recognized brands (PMP, ASTD, etc.), they prefer to do their own certifications in house, which don't mean anything anywhere else."

Customers are Evil,2015-08-11,Specialist,5,,"The people, fellow employees. We're a family in (almost) every store and when you visit other stores you're welcomed with open arms. (makes vacations interesting). Store meetings are like big parties, managers are excellent people-people. High energy, amazing benefits (dental, vision, general), great discounts.","The customers are all horrible. Spoiled teens and kids, entitled adults. Some people think just because they own an apple product they get special treatment. Always angry and foul mouthed. It's rare to actually have a pleasant interaction with a customer."
Management cares if you care,2016-06-13,"Red Zone Specialist in Boston, MA",4,,Great connection with managers that genuinely care about your growth and comfort in the store. Great benefits and rich interactions with many different people throughout the experience.,"Sometimes you are surrounded by people who don't want to work as hard as others, and because there are so many employees in the store, it could at times be discouraging. Don't give in to complacency and push to be better, OR just enjoy working at the store."
"Stressful, but the pay is good",2016-10-26,"Applecare At Home Advisor in Fort Worth, TX",2,,"Excellent pay and benefits, ability to advance within the company, work at home, perks and bonuses such as swag.","super stressful, with little assistance from management; multiple chats from angry customers, you're not given all the tools to accurately assist customers properly; Management is never really clear on company movements and will change requirements on short notice. Schedule changes every 6 months, and you are not guaranteed to get anything that works for you"
Love the Employees & Culture. Inevitable Burn Out,2016-10-27,AppleCare Senior Advisor,4,,"The employees and the corporate culture. Hands down, these two aspects of Apple are reasons to work for the company. Management is great and the support is excellent.","The role of Senior Advisor at AppleCare is unsustainable. To be blunt, it is a soul sucking job. It is embarrassing how rude the demographic of callers are. Abusive to be frank. I wouldn't go back to this role if I was paid twice as much."
I used to love working for Apple,2016-12-04,"Applecare At Home Advisor in Casselberry, FL",3,,"The benefits. Health benefits, generous product discounts, tuition reimbursement, fertility treatment and adoption benefits, transit assistance, 401k, stock and RSU. The benefits at apple are fantastic and I have yet to meet anyone at another company with benefits that compare to apple's.","Working in customer service for Apple can be incredibly emotionally draining. Apple is known for its world class customer service and as a result, customers have come to expect it. In fact, many of Apple's customers have become incredibly entitled. The majority of the customers are still Mostly decent people, but not a day went by without being insulted, harassed, or yelled at by someone. When they aren't rude, they are needy and expect to have their hand held through all troubleshooting, and you are on strict timelines to keep your calls short. This is mostly to be expected in customer service, but Apple is so busy that you find yourself going through this back to back to back to back with little chance to breath. Scheduling changes every 3 months, and it's left up to chance- like a lottery, unless you are a top performer, in which case you can choose your schedule. Being a top performer isn't easy, and the criteria is strict. Your call handling is monitored, critiqued, and micromanaged down to the tiniest details. You are in a break or after call time for 20 seconds too long, and a manager is checking on you to see what's going on. Some people excel at jobs like this, for the rest of us, it is exhausting. The stress began to take a toll on my mental and physical health. I was an Apple Store employee for 7 years, but I only last for 1 as an Apple care advisor. I almost filed for a medical leave because of how sick and crazy this job was making me, but I found a new job instead. The good news is that Apple has fantastic disability benefits, probably because they know how sick and crazy his job makes people."
Maps Editor,2016-12-27,"in Austin, TX",4,,"The bosses could not be nicer people. They were always very kind, patient, understanding and helpful. I would have stayed if it paid enough. They were very upfront and honest. They told me in the interview that I was a contract worker and would not be hired after the year was over. That really impressed me. I can't say enough good things about the people that worked there. Just really great people. Training was phenomenal","The actual tasks of the job were incredibly boring, but I felt I learned a lot. The only reason I left is because I knew it wouldn't go anywhere and I couldn't make ends meet financially."
Good for those who enjoy working from home,2019-06-04,"Technical Advisor in Eugene, OR",4,,"As a college student, I was able to work from home and balance everything with my school schedule. Management is really nice and they make sure that you can learn and grow. Lots of room to move up within.","It's a really big company so there is a large chain of people for certain tasks. If you ask your manager about scheduling, it goes to the next person above him and then the next and so on. Customers can be rude and it's not always super fun just sitting in front on a computer. I didn't like working in my room, but some people had at home offices they could use which probably would have helped."
New Apple culture is all sales based,2019-12-10,Anonymous Employee,1,,Meet really cool people. Work with mostly very high caliber people. Great on a resume.,"Unless you want to get into management its a glass ceiling. As of 2019 the job role is converting into more of a sales-based role. Not concerned with technical troubleshooting anymore. Only about ""making new owners"" instead of fixing problems. Forced to evangelize about every Apple service/product no exceptions. Conversations have to be centered around new products and not about the customers current product.   It's converting into Best Buy or *insert any other ""big-box""* chain store.   The Lead Genius position no longer has anything to do with technical leadership or knowledge. Rather how to drive sales."
"Sometimes great, often terrible.",2008-06-18,"Embedded Software Engineer in Cupertino, CA",3,,"Instant product recognition, everyone in the world knows what an iPod is. It's a hip place, and everyone knows it.

"Like working there, but it is not without downsides.",2008-06-19,"Human Resources in Palo Alto, CA",3,,"Apple has great technology. There are many smart people who work there and it has a culture that rewards innovation. It is hard not to want to work someplace that is known world wide and has a brand that is recognized by everyone. When you say you work at Apple, people love to talk about the products. Apple's products are high quality and fun to use. They have a great campus and when you work there you feel important and like you have contributed to making products that the many people in the world love.",Parts of the company are disorganized and management is not very respectful of people.
Great Company to work for,2008-09-15,Mac Specialist (Apple Store),5,,"Plenty of potential for promotion from within.

To the point,2009-03-09,"Mac Specialist (Apple Store) in Miami Beach, FL",4,,"There is a fantastic culture in the store. Everyone is so relaxed and friendly. It's like one happy family. Great place to socialize with customers and co-workers. Great products of course - If you're as passionate as most of the workers are, then it won't seem like work.   Another great side - Management doesn't breathe down your neck all the time. Although, they do have to meet a quota for Mobile me, applecare, onetoone sales so sometimes they can hassle you if your numbers are low.   Also, if you want time off, they're quite flexible. You just need to give three weeks notice.",There's no commission. The pay is average. Company is very secretive of information.
the coolest retail job around,2009-04-06,Specialist,4,,To say you work for Apple. Apple has created a dynamic workplace where the workers are always going through some type of training to keep up with the always changing product line. They really believe in the success of their workers and develop them for advancement within the company. Apple is Awesome. The perks of working at this innovative technology company are also fabulous.,They should consider giving some type of time off for part time workers. Alot of younger people work at the stores so people tend to band together. Sometime the management tends to not schedule any learning time
"Great place to work. Good people. Good compensation, perks. Employees are treated well.",2009-11-08,"Hardware Engineer in Cupertino, CA",5,,"Work is challenging. The projects are interesting. Perks, benefits and compensation is very good. The people I get to work with are all very talented and helpful.

There are certainly opportunities for growth and promotion within the company. There certainly are perks: between employee pricing on apple, and 3rd party products.","To my knowledge, the pay is not as substantial as other retail environments. That being said, you actually do get to be a part of one of the greatest retail experiences in the world, and that, combined with the experience you'll gain is certainly worthwhile."
Being in the right organization makes a difference.,2016-10-26,"Anonymous Employee in Cupertino, CA",4,,"When you're in the right organization and have the right motivation whether it's the products or projects, you can be fulfilled beyond your expectations. I've seen many people with various capabilities flourish by moving to different organizations if they don't initially find success.","Finding the right cultural fit within Apple seems to be challenging for many people even though there is a general ""Apple"" corporate culture.

Retail Operations and Employee Experience Overvue,2017-01-07,Anonymous Employee,4,,"Strong sense of community, cultural emphasis on service over metrics or commission based pressures. Stock buy-in options, competitive healthcare offerings, vacation, and sick-time accruals. Transit subsidy in major metropolitan areas.","Seasonal product launch waves can lead to extended high stress and volume interactions, causing situational pressures to override cultural principals.

AppleCare At Home Advisor,2017-03-24,"Applecare At Home Advisor in North Canton, OH",4,,"As a chat advisor, you get more freedom than a phone advisor. You can listen to music, not worry about background noise or your tone of voice when communicating with a customer, as all communication is done via Chat.","The hours aren't amazing. As a Chat advisor, we are open 24/7 including all holidays. If you do your job well, you can choose what schedule you want which helps.  Also, working for home isn't for everyone. It's hard to be at home alone all the time, so if your a social person, this may not be the job for you."

"Great company, very disorganized",2018-01-11,"Anonymous Employee in Cupertino, CA",5,,- Loving the work and believing in leadership is a blessing. - Tons of perks. - Passion in the people you work with.,- Too many teams/departments doing things their own way and not adhering to corporate structure.  - Many newer employees lack the Apple culture and don’t even care.  - Hourly employees don’t make a decent wage unless they put in loads of overtime. They also don’t get amazing raises/bonuses/RSUs like salaried employees do.

Great stepping stone,2018-09-15,"Anonymous Employee in Boston, MA",3,,"Professional development, ACMT training, interview prep, benefits, discounts.","Management is usually externally hired, upper management is rarely around yet in charge of your career advancement, schedule is demanding and for the pay, not worth it, customers are already annoyed with wait time by the time they get to you, Apple Corporate is loosely connected to the retail environment, AppleCare over phone support tell customers false information as they are not aware of the retail process."
Apple is the best company I've ever worked for.,2008-04-24,"Education Customer Support Representative in Austin, TX",5,,"Honestly, they're the best company I've ever worked for. Management is both competent and efficient, and communication is fantastic, as well as a sense of doing constant good for the company and our customers.","The schedules swap every 2 months, so you can't plan too much in advance, and sometimes you get phone skilled into departments you have some knowledge in, but not as much as you'd prefer to have when providing the customers support"
"Apple, It's all you want it to be.",2008-05-30,"Mac Specialist (Apple Store) in Alpharetta, GA",5,,"Working at Apple was a very rewarding experience.

You get a discount on stock purchase with employee purchase plans. And you get 25% off Apple branded stuff (not iPhones though). Great for keeping up with the newest laptop.,"Bureaucracy. Managers of managers and employee reviews of employee reviews. Stupid customers (comes with the tech territory). You will never move past your position into management. That is not a path that is possible, if thats what you are looking for, be a manager at Best Buy then apply to apple. They do not promote from within for those roles."
"Great for the short-term, but not the longer than 3 years",2013-12-26,Creative (Apple Store),3,,You get discounts on products that help with purchasing. It's a great place to learning how to interact with people.,"The skills you learn are great, but as soon as you start becoming the long standing member at your store, you will start to understand the business too well and want to jump to conclusions. Customers are the worst and they make you feel bad for decisions the company made about a product that you had no control over. Even the Genius Bar has existed for 10 or so year, customer still come in without an appointment and then blame you why they don't have one."

You find out about new technologies when a customer calls and asks for support on it. The customers. Honestly Apple would be a 5 star if it wasn't for the customers.

Specialist,2015-08-07,"Retail Specialist in New York, NY",3,,Fun job. Meet cool people. Great benefits. Looks good on the resume.,They make it difficult to make any moves to management in the company. Even if you have experience in the past. It's even difficult to make a lateral move in retail stores.

Instructional Designer,2016-05-02,,2,,Great team to work with.,"Poor management and bad pay. The expectations far exceed what they want to pay their employees. Lots of work for no pay and get it done quicker than possible. Also, there was absolutely no time to ramp up and learn the ropes.

Cult-like,2015-10-12,Anonymous Employee,3,,I love the ability to be able to help people with their products and show them how it works.

It also gives me a chance to work on people skills seeing as we get hundreds of people through our doors daily,"On the weekends it seems that the genius bar is well understaffed. The sales side of the store seems to be favored a bit with all the new hires and also with the emphasis during daily meetings with most of it being about how great they do and what they can do to sell more. Also some managers seem to be playing favorites with people. The biggest turn off about working here is that it feels like a cult sometimes. Everyone is so crazy about everything apple and if you're not you're looked at as an outcast. Also, if you're not someone thats nonstop smiling about god knows what and aren't always yakking off about something then you'll never get recognized for the hard work that you do. I've been busting my butt off here for a while now and i have not once gotten recognized at a meeting for it (these meetings have a ""recognition"" portion in them where everyone recognizes someone for their hard work). It's always the same few people giving the recognition to the same few people. Most of the people that work there seem to be trying to compensate for something with their arrogant attitudes or maybe they've been working in southlake so long that the customers' attitudes have brushed off on them."

Specialist,2017-10-30,Specialist,3,,"-The pay is incredible. I work in New York City and I make $18.50 an hour before taxes. The amazing pay is actually also a con, because it's the way they trap you into not looking for other jobs (there are not that many part-time jobs that pay this much). -Related: the benefits are amazing. Great health, dental, and visual insurance. They pay for a portion of your tuition, if you are a student. They pay part of your phone bill - I have the T-Mobile Individual Unlimited plan, which is usually $75/month, and with Apple it's $25/month! They even pay $100 a month for  your friggin' transportation!! -On purpose, they hire people who are either interesting or smart or funny or friendly or have good personalities. As a result, an unusually high percentage of your co-workers (as related to most customer service jobs) are people you will want to know and be friends with. This makes the soul-sucking, ultra-capitalistic work environment vaguely more tolerable and enjoyable.","-You will be subject to something called Net Promoter Score, which is straight out of an episode of Black Mirror. This is where customers rate you out of five stars and leave comments; if a customer gives you five stars they are a ""promoter,"" four stars and they are ""passing,"" less than that and they are a ""detractor."" Did I mention that the managers read literally all of the comments you get, and routinely bring them up? It's incredibly obnoxious. -You will CONSTANTLY AND CONSISTENTLY be blamed for things that are not your fault. I have had customers blame me for misinformation which I got directly from my managers.  -For the most part, the managers are horrible and do not care about you, or even their own jobs. They care about money and that's literally it. -A tip for women: the company is ridiculously misogynistic. Every time I visit the Genius Bar I notice that there are something like 20 men working there to 3 women. Am I supposed to believe that that's a coincidence? Also, I am a female who worked in an IT position for a year and I was given the specialist role, whereas my male friend who has never worked in tech was given technical specialist. -The company is also racist. A recent product was a line of Beats headphones called the ""Neighborhood Collection,"" which was ""inspired by the urban environment"" (a verbatim quote I had to hear every day for about two weeks). The colors the headphones came in were red, blue, and ""army green."" Also, again, the vast majority of Genius Bar employees are white or East Asian."
Great place to work,2018-04-27,"Technical Expert in Washington, DC",4,,Fast-Paced Amazing coworkers Generally Great management Focus on development Discounts Benefits are awesome,The days can be pretty hectic Customers can be pretty bad Sometimes it feels nonstop The pay is relatively low for what your asked to do everyday
Software Engineer III,2018-06-08,"Software Engineer in Cupertino, CA",4,,"It's extremely rewarding to work at the most valuable company in the world. Most employees are dedicated Apple fans, with regards to product and software, which keeps morale high. It's also uplifting to track how many people in the world are using our HW and SW.","We struggle to compete in market in regards to salary, perks, and training. It is also unfortunate that we don't have more Bay Area office space in San Francisco."
Awesome People Work Here,2018-09-27,"Family Room Specialist in Austin, TX",5,,in my role in the retail family room specialist (aka mobile technician at the genius bar) I was surrounded by talented people who really cared about each other and were very skilled in their job duties but also in their hobbies outside of work. It was a great experience to be around those high caliber people.,"Store management could be overbearing sometimes. It could feel micromanaged a bit, but not normally."
Work for few years and quit,2019-01-18,Anonymous Employee,4,,"The experience you gain at Apple makes you very valuable outside. Everybody wants you, if you worked at Apple. My advice is to gain that experience and move to another company, you will make it big in other companies.","Emphasis is always on execution in hardware teams. Hiring strategy is always reactive, senior management does not look forward a few years nor do they fund the hiring staff properly. Growth is very hard to come by, hardware team is almost becoming another Intel"
great place to learn. slow to grow.,2019-04-11,"Senior Data Scientist in Cupertino, CA",4,,"At the beginning you can learn a lot and see how a big company works. Depending on teams, data scientists have a lot of freedom.",Unstructured. Infra structure is not as great as some other big companies. Growth is slow which is natural for big companies.
Great Benifits & People but...,2020-01-06,"Technical Support Advisor in Austin, TX",3,,"I worked both and the retail and corporate environment and they are both different beasts both help build strong skills in leadership, team work, and creative thinking.  Stock and benefit options are really great and you get to work with a lot of wonderful open minded people as well as having a decent work life balance for the most part.  retail is a good place to start if you are just starting college and interest in sales or technology, so long you don't mind a bit of chaos. I do recommend corporate as it is more down to earth and open compared to retail.","Costumers are often allowed to be extremely aggressive and down right abusive which can bring a lot of stress and anxiety, especially for the technical specialists who are required to be empathetic to all they help.  It can also be hard to get full time or even move out of current roles unless you have a good connection with your leadership team or fit a certain personality type. leadership will often sway employees into roles they want them in.  hard to get dedicated training for required knowledge and often have to learn on the fly which often breeds bad habits and misinformation.  finally company's goals and values between retail and corporate often clash and causes much confusion for customers and employees alike."
Purgatory,2020-01-13,Family Room Specialist,2,,"Some truly great coworkers, good benefits and decent employee discount.","Working at Apple is intoxicating at first. But the shine quickly fades. Its a madhouse. Its always busy. People hate and love the stores. Once you move to the repair side it becomes so hard to maintain your positivity, especially if you are stuck in a front line position as long as I was. It will consume your soul. It left me with PTSD and a feeling of worthlessness, even though I was truly Good at my job. Unrealistic expectations for customer approval ratings in a very very tough position. The position evolved from a few key functions when I started into a multitude of repair and sales functions, emphasis on the sales. If you do not like playing the popularity game, you will not grow. Apple is rapidly becoming another mediocre retail corporation in how it runs and manages its stores. And the corporate culture is Cult-Like. That is all."
It’s what you make of it,2020-03-11,"in Los Angeles, CA",3,,"The biggest pro about working with Apple is the benefits. Health insurance is top tier with nominal premiums. RSUs, ESPP, EPP+, discounts on cell services, discounts with retailers and lots of other perks. Gym reimbursement if you don’t work on any of the campuses, bike reimbursement, or pays for commuter services. The company is there for their employees during natural disasters, etc. Free legal advice if you’re going through matters outside of work. Free therapy sessions if needed throughout the year. So many free or highly discounted services and products provided to us. In addition, the amount of opportunity for growth to corporate is unparalleled. If you leverage a career experience or mentor ship well enough, there’s no way you won’t open doors to corporate. (from a retail level)","At the retail level, it’s turned into a “good old boy” hierarchy. Market team leaders being brought in from clothing or big box retailers, hiring all their old buddies as lower leadership. It’s how our retail culture is being lost. Positive intent only thrives within employees that are considered “legacy” thinkers. And “legacy” thinkers don’t get promoted. Work/Life balance does not exist within Apple Retail, even for part timers. At the corporate level, it’s a scramble to fill positions. So we’ve hired so many people that aren’t top tier talent anymore. Friends hiring friends for the sake of friendship, instead of how they can actually perform. Pay is also not as competitive as other companies in SF/Bay Area/San Jose. They don’t like hiring from within for management positions. There are some really great employees and people that I worked with that should’ve been management a long time ago, but they’re quickly passed over."
Apple employees are the rock stars of retail,2008-04-20,"Mac Specialist (Apple Store) in Paramus, NJ",5,,"The soul of Apple, and it's strong point, is the people. Everyone you work with is proud and excited to be there. Everyone believes in the product(s) and are extremely knowledgeable about everything Apple. This was the first place I worked where everyone got along, where I made close friends with, and felt proud to be a part of.   Working at the Apple Store isn't because you want to make money; it's because you want to spread the word about the product because its changed your life and you want to help others do the same. I love it when a first time Mac user comes in and realizes that there is something other than the mainstream PC that will not only work for them, but that they'll have fun with. I can't count the times when a customer makes the switch from PC to Mac (or even Zune to iPod) and they come back just to say ""hi"" or to tell us how great it's working for them. Apple employees are not regular retail workers. We are the rock stars of the retail world. When a customer comes in and asks where something is, we don't just point a finger in the opposite direction. We personally help out customers according to their needs and find them the best solution.   It's a common thing to be on a first name basis with regular customers. I love welcoming people back to the store. They're surprised you remembered them from the one time you helped them out, and that you even remember their name and situation. Working with people at the Apple Store is on a personal level, and that is what makes our customer service excellent.","The only time I felt there was a downside to working at Apple was when it came for a promotion. Granted, working at Apple means growth and moving up. However, I felt that there were several times that there was favoritism going on, as far as promotions. There have been a couple of instances were those being promoted were very close with management, and many felt that the promotion was more deserved to another employee who worked longer or harder.  Another similar situation that has happened before would be when an employee is promised a certain promotion or is ""next in line"" for an opening position, and then it is given to someone else."
Good place for those with wives and kids.,2009-05-23,"Software Engineer II in Cupertino, CA",2,,"Great Product. Somehow, they manage to churn out good products. Salaries are decent. Stock price is going up.","People are really not that smart. Most are middle aged. The young guys are the kind who are not very ambitious (yeah - I have a girlfriend so I want to get done with the work). It is the kind of place where if you were to suggest some startup idea over lunch, they (your colleagues) will shoot it down. Very uninspiring."
Frantic pace. Never a dull moment,2009-06-27,Lead Genius,5,,Always changing. Very flexible. Learn something new every day. Great team environment. High level expectations breeds high level team members.,Very low pay for responsibilities given. Does not seem to be the case in all markets. I find this unfair and should be balanced company wide. If I didn't love the job and company so much I wouldn't put up with it.
Headline,2009-07-15,Software Engineer,5,,"Apple is a company that appreciates and values its employees. The pay and benefits are great. It's great to work with people who are passionate about what they do, and it's also a pleasure to work with management that has a clue.",Apple's well known reputation for protecting information security is sometimes a hindrance in terms of getting things done. This is a shortcoming that requires some adjustment for new employees.
Company Run By A Genius is not necessarily a great place to work!,2009-10-01,Marketing Manager,3,,"Apple still has a great cachet, and is an exciting place to gain industry experience for a newcomer to the industry. However, it is not the best place for a seasoned executive.","Everything depends on the next hit product and of Steve Jobs staying ahead of the competition. Although there is lots to like in Apple's products, they have fallen behind before with Steve Jobs, and he will not be there forever."
Engineering Director,2009-10-09,"Director in Cupertino, CA",4,,"Apple places a very large priority on innovation The people I work with day to day are very smart, creative, and highly motivated to produce killer products",Secrecy makes it hard to do my job Isolated nature of product teams means that more often than not multiple teams are producing nearly the same product

Plus you are constantly around apple products which is obviously fun because they are the best in the world.,"There is no real variation in the employees there.

Great place for professional growth but very little opportunity for career advancement.,2012-01-29,"Mac Specialist (Apple Store) in San Francisco, CA",4,,Great products and people. Solid management structure and overall company direction. Great opportunities to develop career skills for other employers.,"Low wages. Low wages. Low wages. So yeah, low wages coupled with little opportunity for career advancement out of retail into Apple corporate makes for an extremely high turnover ratio."
Corporate vs. Retail are day and night,2012-09-07,"Global Supply Manager in Cupertino, CA",1,,"Creative, innovative, fast paced and exciting. The best products in the world. Only perfection is acceptable. Salary/benefits are competitive. RSUs.","Horrible management. There are probably more managers than there are ICs. The reason for this is Apple just promotes people based on years at Apple. First level managers have no mgmt or leadership skills. I've never seen so many managers have one direct report. Even then, they are not really managing. Awful culture. No training, no support. Everyone is ultra competitive. Zero work life balance. Expect to work 18 hour days, 6.5 days/week. Frequent travel, up to 50%."
"Fantastic environment, benefits, and pay (New York City)",2012-09-26,"Specialist in New York, NY",4,,"•Great people •Good benefits •Better starting pay than most retail jobs •They encourage you to be yourself.  I had the opportunity of working in a large store where there was lots of space to move around and pass the hours. I had a great time, and Apple kept things new and interesting (although I was there for less than a year). If your store does well you may even get a few perks.","•Corporate's been making changes recently, some good some bad. There have been pay raises, but scheduling has gotten stricter."
It depends on which department you work at... avoid IS&T,2013-02-08,"Senior Program Manager in Cupertino, CA",1,,"Apple discount is ok. When you start, you will receive a $500 bonus to be used every 3 years so buy something immediately. 25% off one item from each product family per year - desktop, ipads, iphone, etc. 15% for up to three friends every year. If you work in IS&T and you love project management, then this is for you.","Every IS&T department team is governed by the onshore and offshore vendor model primarily from India companies. If you enter as a developer, you will be involuntarily assigned to work as a technical program/project manager role where you will delegate all your code to onshore and offshore developers. Sometimes you'll get good developers, but most of the time, you'll get mediocre or below-average developers. There is no diversity in this department as the overall ethnicity is 99.999% India descent. Most of the senior managers are not technical, not hands-on and rely solely on the program/project managers/consultants to deliver all projects for them. The technical knowledge is heavily relied on the consultant/contractor engineers. The performance reviews can be conducted arbitrarily and can be tweaked at the discretion of the manager. It depends on the manager's integrity and honor if he/she will base your performance on merit. Over time, the more you do project management work, the less you will do technical work unless you put in long hours at night. The management team will do whatever possible to protect themselves and avoid all risk. There is a lot of politics and arrogance. One director hired most of her managers from her previous company. Everyone who knew the director ascended to management ranks by this association. So either it is by coincidence or maybe cronyism? If you don't belong in that ""3com club"", then you will not be as richly compensated. e.g. The managers brag to their employees about buying and/or rebuilding 1- 3 million dollar homes (ground up) in areas of Saratoga, Cupertino, and Evergreen.   Just to emphasize, this is for the Apple IS&T department. All other product development teams - iCloud, iTunes, etc. will not have this environment. Furthermore, it can be confirmed that those departments are more diverse in ethnicities, rely on badged employees for development work, and work long hours depending on the team and project."
Heavy focus on development,2016-07-19,"Specialist in Boulder, CO",5,,You work with amazing people that have incredible backgrounds! There is a heavy focus on personal development and you feel that Apple really cares about making an investment in you.,"Customers can take a lot of energy to deal with.

At-Home Advisor,2016-08-18,"Home Advisor in Tuscaloosa, AL",5,,"Apple is an amazing company. The benefits are outstanding and your team and manager really care about you, as a person, and how you are doing. You are graded on meeting a certain criteria of stats on your calls, but are always given tips on how to get there.","The biggest downside is working alone. If you are a very social person, the only interaction you get with people is through the phone. For me, it was awful. I needed to be with people."
Perfect job during college,2016-10-02,Anonymous Employee,5,,"Working at an Apple Store was the perfect job for me during college. The management understands that you have other commitments outside of work, and is super flexible in making time for your life outside of Apple.","It can be hard to advance at an Apple Store, and there are a lot of politics and seniority that comes into play when you try to move up."
"Great products, great company as a whole, losing focus in education of what got them there",2017-01-10,Anonymous Employee,4,,"Solutions are solid. Products are fantastic. For the most part, job descriptions are accurate. Compensation and benefits are good.",Way too much operational focus in the field and loss of what got them to what they are. Work life balance was not good when I left. Mr. Cook needs to have better oversight of field management by executive team. Be prepared to spend more time analyzing business than actually selling.
Best in retail.,2017-05-10,Anonymous Employee,5,,"Great benefits, decent growth when just starting out as a specialist, accommodating, and really the best company I've worked for as far as retail is concerned.","After a promotion or two, there isn't much room for growth. People stuck in the same positions for 6+ years easily. Easy to get complacent, but it's customer service so you know how that can be. Retail Corporate under Angela is not great, and the changes they've made are slowly making it worse."

Incredible learning experience,2018-01-23,"Anonymous Employee in Palo Alto, CA",5,,"Apple Retail: Easily among the most technically astute, personable, and hard-working people I have ever encountered. These people will do anything to help their colleagues and their customers. It's a tough job, as the products are numerous, complex, and ever-changing.

It's gratifying to see the new generation ""get"" what Apple is about.","If there are an ""cons"", they are so negligible as to be not worth mentioning."

Account Executive,2018-03-24,"Account Executive in New York, NY",2,,Iconic company that makes great products. You can pretty much meet with any senior executive with Apple on your badge.,Many.

"Good Pay, Bad Customers",2015-10-20,Anonymous Employee,3,,"Pay was nice, very good hours and pay for a college student. I would recommend any student who needs to pay for college to take this opportunity in a heart beat. No experience required and they accept almost anyone.",The management team hardly every spent time helping the workers. They often had meetings and were too busy to assist. They piled on every job title into one so your spectrum of coverage doubles every month. The customers are often times so dumb you hang up without even trying.

They promote based on if you fall in line with what they say and if you brown nose well enough. They don’t care if you’re a great performer. You gotta “play the game”! No work life balance.

It's kinda cool to be at the cutting edge of technology hipness. Plus you get to use Apple products in your daily work, which is a definite plus. There's a lot of excitement in the atmosphere from people who are truly energized by what they do. The ""coolness"" of the corporate culture make it the kind of place where people are impressed when you tell them who you work for. And the overall industry affection for all things Apple make it the kind of place where you don't worry if your company will be in business in 6 months.","There's a decided lack of creative freedom, very little room for advancement, and atrociously bad management. Only certain people are allowed to have ideas, and many of us who were hired because of our creative background have to stifle our experience and just do what we're told. It also has the worst management I've ever experienced. I had 5 different managers in 18 months and not one of them every held a one-on-one with me. Even when I requested time with a new manager, they were too busy impressing their own manager to deal with the people who reported to them. It's sad to see so many great ideas never get off the ground because the people who came up with them weren't ""important"" enough. Plus there's this huge ""high school clique"" mentality of the cool kids vs. everyone else. If you aren't one of the cool kids, you don't get to work on the interesting projects, get noticed my management, or have any chance to prove what you can do."

I work at the Genius Bar. Every tiny detail of each repair I perform is micromanaged. If something goes off script, it is used against you later on.

Cons outweigh the Pros by a landslide,2018-01-23,"Anonymous Employee in Paramus, NJ",1,,"Would only recommend if you are 18 in college and looking for career growth with a technology company:  Awesome co-workers, no dress code, judgement free, great benefits: medical, dental, optical, gym reimbursement, tuition reimbursement, store gift card and discounts for both part time and full time employees.","Extremely negative work environment*** - Everyone, both customers and employees are miserable. Written all over everyones face. Energy is so negative its hard not to absorb it.  0 work life balance.  - No such thing as availability, required to have open availability weekdays and weekends. Typical shifts are 12:30-9:30, 1:30-10:30, 11-8.   CONSTANTLY HAVING TO BE THE BEARER OF BAD NEWS: - Wait times for appointments being HOURS for same-day service and at least a week for book-from-home.  - Repair prices typically starting at $149+ tax for failures entirely out of the customers control. Devices fail for no reason frequently. If the customer is outside one year without extended warranty 0 exceptions are made and the customer has to pay out of pocket. The company has grown so massively, the products are made in massive increments and not with close attention to detail. - Customers losing all of their precious information (contacts, photos, text messages etc) because they don't know how to backup their information.  Customer expectations are high and they feel entitled - belittling constantly - angry customers cursing - getting called names solely because you were the shirt and work for the company  Compensation - They start you higher than the average retailer but for what you have to deal with and for how much the company makes daily, weekly, annually.. its actually a joke.  - After taxes and benefits get taken out, only average $10-12 an hour. Constantly having sales and business goals to meet but no commission or incentives based on fantastic performance. Average sales were over $100,000 a month and you see absolutely nothing.  - Annual raise is a mere .40 cents"
If you love being micro managed and having ZERO work/life balance this is the place for you!,2018-06-21,"Creative in Northridge, CA",1,,"I worked at a Retail store for almost 10 years...  Great benefits, Stock options, pretty good discounts, meet some of the coolest people you'll ever meet.","ZERO. WORK/LIFE. BALANCE. ZERO underlined, and in bold. Good luck trying to ever get a shift covered in the likely event that you need to have a certain day off. Full Timers do not get to pick a designated day off, rather, they only get a ""preferred"" day off which is never granted.  You cannot have any weekend days off. You must have full and open availability. Part Timers must have 4 days of full availability... which makes it impossible to be a full time student and have a job with this place.  You will get sick A LOT. They do not use anything even close to something that sterilizes when cleaning... Oh and don't sit on those little squishy ball seats at the kids table... We call them ""pee-balls"" for a reason...  You will be constantly micro-manged to the point it's hard to tell if they're actually harassing you.  You will get zero training time and expected to know everything about the latest software and hardware.  You will be constantly running around like a chicken with it's head cut off helping multiple people, answering STUPID questions that could've been simply googled from customers and coworkers.  There is little to no opportunities for growth. Unless you become the managers little pet and bend to their every whim, then MAYBE you'll get an interview for something, but end up losing out to an external hire. Lastly, you will not be valued there. You are just a mere cog in the big corporate machine that is Apple. They can easily replace you regardless of how much time, blood, sweat and tears you gave to that place. The Apple culture that made the company so awesome and unique no longer exists. It has been long gone. It died in 2010. Angela Ahrendts is a cancer to Apple Retail."

Great personalities in coworkers, family-like environment where everyone sticks together and looks out for one another. Management that really looks out for the employee, tries to remain fair and balanced. Respect from the public for working for the brand. Fair balance of breaks and lunch time to break up the monotony.","LIterally no work-life balance. Swing shifts every day, no set hours or days off for part time or full time. Schedule is made only a week in advance, not uncommon to work 7 to 9 to 12 day stretches without a day off. Poor flow of customer interactions, many many angry people all day who take out their frustration of the flawed system on you. Appointment system for tech help is mediocre at best, technicians are overworked, overbooked, underpaid and in constant demand from increasingly impatient and upset customers. Fair pay, but underpaid for the amount of stress and disequilibrium the job entails. On your feet on limestone floors all day, without insoles will cause back pain, knee pain and feet pain if not finding time to sit down every few hours. Hardest retail position I've ever worked."

Apple Retail is an entirely separate entity,2014-12-10,"Anonymous Employee in Raleigh, NC",1,,"- Benefits cannot be matched by any other employer (PPO plan)  - Great employee discounts on peripherals and phone plans - Relative to other retail stores, this is one of the best to work for","- Retail ages ware barely enough to be able to buy computers, even with the discount, rendering the discount almost useless. They're really great as favors for friends/family who have jobs that pay more than yours.  - Management is extremely skilled at giving you the runaround (also known as Feedback) when it comes time for promotion or a lateral shift in positions. Interviews either end up going cold with no response, or some ""surprise star candidate"" will swoop out of nowhere to take the position you desire so dearly.  - Glass ceiling. Extremely little room for advancement. Someone has to either die or get fired for a spot to open up. There are pretty much 2-3 positions you can move into before ""management' is the next step, where you get a nice little raise to get yelled at by more customers and deal with disgruntled employees who have no future.  - Resume killer. Once you've spent enough time in retail, you're essentially silo-ing yourself into that industry. Recruiters will see your experience as retail and generalize you as a retail salesperson, despite your own perception that you do not work at Macy's, Best Buy, Urban Outfitters, etc. If retail is your career choice, you're in the right place. If it isn't, you're screwing yourself.  - Methodologies to provide customers with ""options"" for service are really just an euphemism for coercing the customer to conform to the workflow that Apple has set out. You are taught to repeat the same ""option"" repeatedly until the customer gives up, and agrees with you. That is NOT successful negotiation. It's not truly a choice if you can only provide the option to take it or leave it. That is called communism/socialism/totalitarianism. (ps. This is America.) - False perception of creativity. Apple positions itself as a company that breeds creativity. Truth be told, the retail store is merely a delivery mechanism for distributing products. As an employee, you have no impact on product development, processes, etc. You are merely a drone whose role is to hand customers product with a smile and collect payment. (The finger doesn't tell the brain what to do. The finger does what it's supposed to do.)"

Flexibility with schedule as long as you plan in advance. Many options for movement internally or to a different location.,Exhausting customer service work for customers that often feel entitled and not very grateful.

"Demanding customer facing role, it is what you make it!",2023-03-14,"Product Zone Specialist in Toronto, ON",4,,"Apple is a internationally known trillion dollar company, so of course there are pros and cons to working for them. The wages and benefits are highly competitive and make it really hard to want to leave. Depending on what store you work at the culture can either be the best or the worst part of the job. On the sales floor [not the genius bar] customers are generally nice and excited about getting a new product and open to hearing your recommendations and expertise. You truly do make so many great connections both with customers and coworkers and meet all kinds of interesting people. Micromanaging could be considered an issue. However, the drive for results is mostly based on expectations from higher-ups as it is with most sales driven roles. Growth and development is challenging and if you are looking to “move up“ then prepare to go through many phases of interviews. Those who are outgoing and energetic are typically favoured over those who are not. All in all Apple can be a very fun and exciting place to work if you don’t let numbers and the pressure get to you.","Micromanaging could be considered an issue.

Expensive Products - Apple products tend to be on the pricier side compared to other brands. 2. Limited Customization - Apple devices are not as customizable as competing brands, which makes it difficult for users to personalize their devices. 3. Limited Software - Apple's software offerings are limited compared to other brands, as Apple does not allow third-party software to be installed on its devices. 4. Limited Support - Apple offers limited support for its products, and often times users have to go to third-party service providers for help with their Apple products. 5. Closed Ecosystem - Apple has a closed ecosystem, which makes it difficult for users to switch between different operating systems and devices."

working condition at apple is really good,2022-12-13,Human Resources in Dubai,4,,"1. Benefits One of the most attractive attributes of working at an Apple store is the great employee benefits they provide. They offer a comprehensive healthcare package that pays for medical-related expenses and preventative care. The healthcare plan Apple utilizes is one of the best in the industry and allows employees to get medical attention to prevent certain conditions and maintain those chronic conditions. Apple also offers its employees other benefits such as financial perks and savings options to help pay for retirement, future expenses, and plan for any major purchases. 2. Rewarding Working at an Apple Store can be rewarding for many employees. Various duties include helping individuals solve problems or purchasing the right products for their particular needs. It can be a very positive experience to cultivate customer relationships over time and ensure that each person gets the best service and assistance. Some instances can include retrieving lost information, transferring phones, and electronic details, assisting with purchases, etc. 3. Challenging Unlike many other technology and retail-related jobs, Apple store jobs can be challenging and provide an environment that encourages growth and learning. Many retail jobs can become tedious and monotonous for workers and pose little to no challenge. However, working at an Apple Store, there is always a new challenge to assist customers and something new to learn almost daily. It is a great way to stay engaged with work and look forward to solving issues for customers along the way. 4. Diversity The Apple Store is a business that prides itself on diversity. They hire from various backgrounds and cultures to ensure a complete representation of society and actively select the best candidates based on their previous education and experience in the industry. That means that truly qualified people usually land the job. Anyone who values diversity in hiring and working in a multicultural environment will enjoy working at one of the Apple Store locations worldwide. 5. Education People who work at the Apple Store can get continuous education related to the latest products and technological applications for Apple-related devices. Additionally, Apple ensures their employees at the Apple store stay up-to-date on the latest techniques and information related to sales, service, and maintenance. Individuals who like to learn and stay on the cutting edge of technology will get great satisfaction working in an environment where continuous education related to Apple products is promoted and expected. 6. Resume Whether an Apple Store employee decides to stay in their position permanently, having a job with an Apple store always looks great on a résumé. This is especially true for individuals who want to keep in a technology-related field. Employees of the Apple store are required to learn many different skills, and other employers know that individuals selected to work with Apple are likely to have a wide and varied skill set that is an asset to just about any company. 7. Upward Mobility Those who choose to take a position with an Apple store at an entry level can look forward to the possibility of promotion in management and a relatively short time. One of the great perks of working at an Apple Store is moving into management after a certain timeframe. Management positions offer competitive salaries and the ability to create stability. There are usually plenty of management positions available within an area. Apple does not solely hire from within, so there may be the opportunity to work beginning at the management level if the applicant has adequate credentials and experience. 8. Work in Any City There are Apple Stores in almost every city across the country. That means that individuals can work at an Apple Store in just about any place they choose. If you start at a particular Apple Store and want to move, there is always the opportunity to transfer to a store near the new location. That offers greater flexibility and the ability to travel to other locations if desired. Employees may also want to transfer to another location for management opportunities.","1. Long Hours Many Apple store employees have reported that the Apple store expects them to work long hours. Many employees at Apple stores report excessive overtime hours and issues with time off during certain holidays. Unlike many other technology companies, the Apple store tends its employees to wear clothes that require them to work long hours to complete. While this may mean significant pay for workers, it can also be the source of employee burnout after a time. 2. No Work/Life Balance Employees of the Apple Store have consistently argued that it is difficult to maintain a good work/life balance at the Apple Store. The long hours and fluctuating schedule may mean working the majority of days off at times and dealing with erratic schedules at times. There is no guarantee of time requests being granted for family events, vacation, or sick leave. That means employees must be prepared to work more than the average industry employee, especially during the busy times of the year. 3. Challenging to Stand Out It can be very difficult to stand out from other employees at the Apple Store. The work is fairly standard and does not leave much room for employees to really shine. In order to get a promotion to management, the employee must adhere to all the company’s standards and perform consistently rather than stand out on their own merits. This can be a negative point for some who wish to stand out via their outstanding performances. 4. Too Many Managers The possibility of promotion of management is a benefit of working at the Apple Store, but the excessive number of managers at any one location can also be a downside. Many Apple store employees report they felt too many management positions were available within the company and specific locations. Individuals hoping to manage a store may find fewer opportunities and less prominent than standard management positions at any Apple Store location. 5. Too Much Work There is a great deal of work for employees who work at an Apple Store. Since Apple is one of the most popular electronic brands on the market, there are always many customer issues to address. That can mean longer than average hours and having to go the extra mile. 6. Not Enough Time Off Along with the potentially excessive workloads and long hours comes limited time off. This is especially true for those employees who fill management roles. Managers are expected to work when needed and may not always get the standard two days off per week. Additionally, workloads vary according to season and need. 7. Difficult Customers Working with difficult customers is always a con of any retail job. However, working with electronics in a major electronics retailer may mean putting up with more than the average number of difficult customers. Having a cool demeanor and level head is extremely important for those working at an Apple Store."

Everything impacts your score and if you take longer breaks it impacts your shifts so you dont get the chance to chose your shifts and you can forget having 2 days in a row off. By getting the late shift you receive the lunch break already pre programed in your schedule and its at 3pm when the cantine is closed, so your lunch is in the vending machine. Every call you make is so scripted that you get afraid of speaking freely so you dont get punished. They expect you to finish a call in 10 minutes but they tell you that you must stay with the customer as long as they ask. The customers are super rude and abusive because of apples policies. Your salary is so low that its almost like an iPhone price. I dont have the words to explain the mental tiredness after every day spent at this mental institution. Stay away from Apple Care!!"

A tease,2011-04-18,,4,,"Apple is an amazing company, with cutting edge products, unparalleled customer service focus and a place that cultivates a family atmosphere. Very enjoyable working environment.","Pay: For the level of excellence demanded, the intensity of interactions with the public and the required knowledge for the positions, not being able to pay your bills at the end of the month, makes it hard to justify the dedication. After all, in the end, a job is still a job, even if your are working for the greatest company in the world.   Management: There seems to be a growing trend towards management that is from the 'outside' and therefore, though possibly able to manage people, managing tech people seems to be a challenge. Apple is an environment of highly creative, aggressive problem solving, tech savvy employees. The management skills needed to perform to Apples standards of excellence and meet the demand of the employees seems lacking.   Career path growth opportunities: From what I have seen and experienced, it appears that the red tape involved in 'moving up' is greater within the company, than without. There is more to prove, more demanded, and higher expectations placed on employees wanting to move within Apple, then if one was to come in from the outside. It has been said, the best way to move up is to transfer or leave, get promoted and get rehired. This seems both unnecessary and unfortunate."

Apple acknowledges that their products are more expensive than the base products from other companies, but the performance from Apple's products are exceptionally better. They provide extensive training in their hardware and software products.","Even though they pay a very competitive salary, it starts as a part time position. You really have to be a very outgoing person and produce great ""numbers"" in order to move into full time positions. They also have a strict attendance policy, and it is not clear as to what exactly leads to termination.

Apple Retail - Very Good for What it is.,2018-09-22,"Technical Specialist in Toronto, ON",4,,"Pays you better than any other retail job.  Got to pretend I worked for a tech company and had a real job even though I just problem solved basic user issues.  No pressure to sell.  Very good hiring practises, I liked all of my coworkers.  You get benefits even when part-time.  You work for a company that generally has very good practises in terms of privacy.  Lots of retention. So many coworkers were 5+ years with Apple retail.  High accountability for workers and management.",You work in a mall or plaza.  You ultimately work retail and therefore have to deal with retail hours and customer entitlement.  Management talk about work/life balance but you never really get a proper weekend. Usually one day off some more work days an then another day off.  You work for Apple Retail not Apple Corporate. There is a giant divide. Less benefits. Less involvement. Less pride.   It feels like it would take a miracle to ever transfer to Corporate even if you had relevant skills.  Pretty extreme expectations in terms of Work Reviews. Very very good workers did not seem to get rewarded for their behaviour due to arbitrary and unrealistic customer-review expectations.
Looks great on your CV!,2011-04-14,,3,,"Overall, the employees are very nice, very smart, and very dedicated. There's an optimistic spirit. You feel like you're a part of something, particularly during product launches. Look around and you'll find some development opportunities through brown bag lunches and employee development offerings. Seek out mentors. But know your boundaries, too.","Apple seeks employees who excel in their areas of expertise, but depending on which department you end up in and which manager you get (they change often and there's layer upon layer of hierarchy), you may find yourself in a narrowly defined job with limited ability to use your existing skills. You also might not get an opportunity to develop new skills. Expect to work long work hours. Unlike a startup, you don't have much hope for advancement -- if you start as a drone you might remain a drone. You have to learn the political landscape, and it takes a while. Some people really thrive there and can move around. Others stay and take what they're given. And a few get kicked off the island."
"Over-promise, under-deliver.",2013-12-10,"Family Room Specialist in London, England",3,,"Apple does an excellent job of recruiting people who are friendly, interesting, and conversationally engaging. The end result being that you're colleagues are a largely awesome group of people who you love working with.","The company recruitment material likes to brag about how your job is so much more than retail. What that really means is that it's retail, with a lot more hard work. You are either pushed to sell phones (and position a enormous number of add-ons) or you are trouble shooting the most tedious issues for weeks on end. It is a mentally and emotionally exhausting job."
Great job. Tough to get into though.,2015-11-05,"Specialist in London, England",5,,"Substantial amount of benefits for all employees.  Managers talk to you like friends, not robots. Relaxed and chilled environment to work in. The ability to be yourself without having to restrict your personality. Looks great on your CV. Potential to grow into the Corporate business building. Selection of trousers and shoes/trainers to your choice (exc. tracksuits) also can wear any accessories on arms, legs etc.","No tips or bonuses, which hurts when you sell 100-1000 Macs a day or meet famous people and want to reward you for how well you've looked after them with your service. On your feet most of the day."

Sometimes during busy periods, it is difficult to request time off (ie. summer before back to school and the holidays). Employee Purchases, for new take at least a month and have to be made online to receive Employee discount on products."
Not at all what I expected,2013-01-31,Creative (Apple Store),2,,"Co-workers, product discounts, occasional interesting client projects.","High school politics, micromanagement, holding up opportunities for potential people, constantly teaching people basic computer skills gets mundane. Work/life balance is terrible. I don't see much of a future here. ""Credo"" and ""culture"" are a bit to be desired. One thing to believe in the products but the culture is way too much ""juice"" with their ""fearless feedback"", etc. Too many employees also don't know much about the product and use."
Variety is great but don't confuse it with inconsistency managers.,2016-10-25,"Senior Manager in Manchester, England",3,,People - the way that we recruit diverse and interesting people. Put them all together and it's just amazing - if only the rest of the world could follow suit as it's changed the way i think and interact with the world around me.,Say the right things to the right people to get on. I know real life is like this but it's not really apple. Also a percentage of customers feel that poor customer service is not being seen in the moment or having to pay for something they have broken! This part of the role really is unbelievable and they way that these people talk to us ! Wow is all I can say.
Good company for first job & for learning about what do you want or not as an employee,2018-05-02,IOS Technical Support Advisor in Cork,3,,"- such a good wage for the kind of position. - Great benefits: fitness center opened 7d/24h with great equipment; cafeteria with great cookers and good food; health center (dentist, gynecologist, ophthalmologist) on site; reduction on Apple products. - There is a lot of career opportunities in AppleCare if you have a good manager who will support you and advise you. AppleCare department is good place to learn about competition, stress, patience and perseverance.","- Compare to companies as Google, Facebook or Salesforces which are based in Ireland too, they all do free food, sport and free transport. Apple makes its employees pay for food, sport and transport. - Poor transport : bus are always late, bus are not regular, it’s so expensive for its service. Apple should get its own bus for its employees. It would reduce daily stress."
apple is a great place to work and is every cool nerd's wet dreams,2010-11-22,in Singapore,3,,"one of the main reasons to work for apple now is that apple is the coolest and also the biggest per capital company on the planet now.  i is a story of how a company is able to take over technology and make it usable and valued  working in apple has been a great adventure till now and the only thing is the employee benefits could be better and also career advangement could be better too  however if you are looking for a good place to work and make lots of friends who also love apple , come to apple to work.","career advanceement , work life balance , overall compensation , timely and early sharing of information. cross departmental communications could be better, more flexible in letting us persue other out of work interest which may eat into working time"

singled out and torn down,2013-07-12,"Family Room Specialist in Winnipeg, MB",1,,"generally speaking, co-workers were great to work with, same with customers","serious lack of positive reinforcement. you never hear the end of it if you do something wrong and nothing when you do well. managers are completely uninterested in the employee side of the story. managers single people out. zero work-life balance. fearless feedback is a load of bull and management doesn't follow their own policies. i was constantly and consistently put down and with the exception of two leaders, was spoken down to and treated like i was incompetent and i know i'm not. they always focused on what you did bad and didn't give a crap when you did something well. once labelled, you will stay labelled. little room to move and grow. near zero support for dealing with abusive customers."

Tons of opportunities to grow your skill set, lots of tailored and highly commendable training. Each role is well thought out, you feel very well looked after happy to work hard.","As with any big company, difficult to have a voice. It's difficult to get an opinion anywhere than 1 or 2 tiers above you. Staff work very very hard and often the hardest workers are not promoted. Pay jumps between roles is often minimal and it's easy to reach a ceiling in a couple of years."
Please Simplify!,2018-01-14,"Anonymous Employee in London, England",2,,"An incredible company where every area of the business is trying to leave the world better than they found it. You will work with insanely intelligent & talented people, a real privilege to work side by side with them.","The retail arm of the business has become arrogant and bloated. Politics is rife and 'perception' is the main message of success. It often looks like a popularity context. Steve's message of 'simplify, simplify, simplify' has been forgotten. A product line up where you can't justify why there are so many SKUs in a line up? 1990s Apple without the financials?"

Great company to work for despite talent retention issues,2019-02-17,Anonymous Employee,4,,"Fantastic benefits, feels good to say you work for 'Apple', great career opportunities if you work hard and are a go-getter","Unfortunately, despite spending 5 years on developing someone, they let them go so easily – because there's no talent team watching and monitoring internal talent. Apple invested lots of time and money into my personal and professional development and then let me leave to join another business because of their lack of opportunities given to internal talent."
"Good people, but need to increase flexibility",2019-08-21,Technical Specialist,3,,"I found all my coworkers to be wonderful, interesting and for the most part good at their jobs. Apple did a good job at accommodating unexpected personal issues. Being placed in the Genius Bar team, I felt there was a reasonable amount of opportunity for progression.","The requirement to have 4 days availability as a part timer and them consistently rostering you on for all 4 days was difficult. Many of the other part time employees were students like me and that makes it very difficult to balance full time study and work. Customers can also be extremely rude, so if you are easily affected by the moods of other people it may not be the best place for you."
Good College/High school job,2010-07-06,Specialist,4,,Good pay for a part time sales job Great people in the form of employees and customers excluding bad apples (no pun intended) Good discounts and other benefits,"Management stresses the perfect solution for every person but if that doesn't include things like MobileMe or ProCare that they are pushing at that moment then you are doing something wrong.

Training (when you can get it) and opportunities (if you have a supporter) can be good. Products and services are outstanding.,"Political. Back stabbing. Cliques. Stores are crowded and noisy. Perks removed, apparently because of Steve Jobs. You definitely need to have an ally in management. Employees ""spy"" on each other in the name of ""feedback.""

Great place to work - especially if you don't have or care about your family.,2012-05-09,,4,,Professional environment. Lots of freedom/flexibility.,"Far too much weekend work ""expected"". It's like wearing a badge of honor to diss your family in favor of a weekend at the office.

Loved working at Apple,2016-10-28,Anonymous Employee,5,,"Great benefits, brilliant management. Company seems to care about the staff, its customers and its place in the world. Excellent and exciting opportunities for employees to progress their career, and move into other areas both within store and outside of store.

The stores are ever changing and Apple develops its people more so than just teach tasks.,"It can be difficult to advance at Apple because of the high requirements they look for even in positions that would not necessarily be deemed as such.

Drink the Koolaid @ Apple.,2012-11-27,AHA IOS Advisor,2,,"- Excellent health benefits at a very decent cost.  - Average to above average pay for position and it was full-time.  - Work with exciting products.  - They reimburse you for internet/phone. - You get a pretty nice iMac to use at your home for job functions. - Working from home (Can be a con as well, see below)","- Working from home (This could be a pro for some) as long as you are a definite homebody, if not you will get sick of it fast. - Management is scattered and clueless, and they are always hiring new Team Manager's instead of finding someone from within to promote. These people are as clueless about things as new hires are, because they are new hires. - Everything is very number driven about your goals. Even the ""mini-teams"" we had with a leader of each team. There was at least 4-5 emails per day about something number related. - To be on the frontier for technology, Apple's internal systems ALWAYS go down, or something is wrong with them. You are expected to maintain the same customer focus even though you don't have the tools to do your job.  - While experiencing down time due to system errors, the main system iLog can't track your login times. Don't expect to be paid for this as I was told I will not be, even though you were working with internal departments to get it resolved. Work for free! - You are tracked by aux codes in iLog system you use to help customers.  - Some people are helpful, but you also have people that don't want to assume responsibility when you transfer a call to their department. A lot of people are very snobby and have the ""big head"" about knowing their products. Most of these situations are people that have been with Apple for several years.  - The company is experiencing growing pains. I am very OCD and it drives me nuts how backwards and disorganized the tools you use and the management is about daily processes.  - Putting in comments and fixing your time card can be a nightmare if you have vacation or sick time to input.  - Very hard to move into a substantial role within the organization. Whether you continue to work from home or move into retail. It's slim to none, unless you reside/work in California or Texas."

If you answer emails during the weekend, public holidays or annual leave; don't expect a thank you. Everyone is overworked and just accepts it as the Apple culture.

Fairytale,2016-09-21,"Sales Specialist in Covent Garden, England",2,,Lovely team to work with. Staff are very knowledgable and work together.,"Management and HR are useless. The managers are not passionate about technology or Apple. They get hired from different management roles of other retail stores and have no clue about Apple culture and how to manage their team. This is a general opinion of all the staff at the store. Also, managers get asked for feedback as to who is a great team member which makes no sense. Experts used to be asked which is logical - they can see who is capable of resolving problems, who is learning more skills and understanding the new tech updates and giving correct customer service.  The HR team are not HR trained. They have NO people skills! It is seriously ironic. They do not listen, are not approachable and very fascist with the rotas/breaks/holidays/hours flexibility. I have never had to get anything changed but many of my colleagues suffered huge stress from unhelpful HR which make their work/life balance miserable. Yet, it is ok to make people work 8 days straight. At the core training everyone was explained time and time again that its not about the sales, its about giving customers correct information and honest service, not trying to make more money from something they don't need. Halfway throughout my time there - let's see who made most sales; there will be rewards. Horrid. You cannot progress. They promise ability to move and go up to different areas of Apple. No can do. Some creatives have been stuck as sales specialists for 5 years without being allowed to move to teaching (and they teach outside Apple)"
Apple Review,2016-11-03,,5,,"Great atmosphere and drive, great future for the company and looks great on your CV as well. 100% can recommend.","Boring job, bad internal tools make getting stuff done a lot more pain than it should be in an ideal world."

Amazing and talented colleagues from all walks of life. Apple recruits well and it shows in the people they hire. The occasional interesting customer.","Apple customers are very entitled and its no surprise, they get rewarded for bad behaviour. Grown adults come into stores and throw a tantrum, you say no, management says yes and so it goes.  Quite poor work life balance but you cant expect much more from retail.   Company culture can often feel cult like and robotic. Leadership were very fake and again robotic, it is hard to get a human response from the majority, its like they read off a script.   There was a huge shift in culture in the time i worked there it became all about targets and numbers under the false pretence that it was about the people customers and colleagues alike, it wasn't.  Once the excitement of being hired by Apple wears off, you will realise that you're just a glorified shop keeper don't let the job titles fool you going in. You are a common retail assistant undervalued and the high turnover rate is consistent with other companies. Apple retail is a separate entity you will not be treated as though you are part of the bigger corporation.   Although the pay is decent for retail it is not decent for Apple. There are days where you will make sales in total which will more than double your yearly salary just by serving lets say 10 people in a day."

Another Ibrick in the IWall,2018-02-22,Enterprise Technical Support Advisor in Cork,1,,You can experience what being part of the hive mind means .   You can buy a phone for 100 euro.  The name is all that matters.,"Let me start by saying that the position has very little enterprise left in it due to the fact that Apple is making very little money from their professional products and some of them have been discontinued/phased out or replaced with their consumer counterpart. This is a glorified consumer support nowadays, with ALL the implications of it. I would not be surprised if they will outsource it too.  When I started, we were supposed to support Pro apps/servers/SOHO integration. By the end of the first year, 1 pro app was discontinued, the other two had very little call volume (meaning that only people using them privately knew how to support them), training for servers was left to people's goodwill (or naivety, depending on the point of view) since apple did not care about their servers and SOHO was a sorry joke about assisting old people resetting their routers. If you have any skills, this position is a slap in the face, if not an hindrance to your career. Unsurprisingly, by the end of my second year, 94% of my team of 15 people had been replaced with much less skilled advisors, which are also payed less.  During the week, 90% of your daily activity at apple will be trying to ""convince"" people with blocked phones that the consumer- hostile policy you are trying to push their way makes sense, all the while repeating nonsensical pre-written statements about how happy you are the customer is using apple. And don't forget to ALIGN! whatever that means.  You work on Saturday/Sunday for no reason, since the kind of service does not require availability, and you get maximum two calls (about locked phones).  Enjoy sitting there for hours doing nothing on the weekend.  Nowadays, it is just call after call from angry people forcefully transferred by the outsourced t1, which uses every possible excuse to transfer enraged people your way, just to avoid getting a bad survey.  The training provided is cheap, in particular after the few experts have been forced to leave, and also totally for your own development useless you want to stay in that same position your entire life. You can get their certifications but you will not really be able to use them outside of apple. You should really put all your efforts into taking a couple more expensive certifications from other vendors and then just leave.  Due to the fact that many people are buying into the rationale that being part of a big company gives them prestige or personal value, apple will always have a cohort of drones ready to replace the ones that open their eyes and leave.  Having some sort of public persona (like being part of some public organization or organizing public events) will boost your career incredibly, since apple will be able to put their hat on it, while doing 0 for it. In that case, you will be promoted as soon as it is technically possible, which means 6 months. As a consequence, career paths are 100% reliant on your social skills and 0 or your actual skills/work ethic.  It has become a recurring joke with one of my ex colleagues (an engineer) which applied to a position, only to have a guy flipping burgers in mcDonalds being hired instead of him.  The people working there are among the worst I have ever met. Cronyism is rampant, with people referring relatives/friends and then giving each others kudos in the end of the year review or abusing the WOW, to boost their stats and be promoted.  Some will go out of their way to downplay others, quite often starting real wars between teams to either make themselves look better or to diminish other people's results. Managers using WhatsApp to discuss work related matters.  Team nights were relatives/partners are invited.  One thing I have never seen anywhere else that often happens in apple is that someone will make up an issue and its solution, and then go around advertising the fake issue as the most important and critical of all. Then of course they come up with the solution and they get credited by their managers, which are not going to waste time trying to double check facts.  Some other people have built their careers by rewriting public facing articles in the internal wiki and ""selling"" them as their own original work to their managers.  Unless you want to live in Cork, which is a nice city but does not offer much, you can only work from home. If you work from home, your career chance reaches negative values. You are going to be cut off from any social activity and be checked for every action. There is no way for you to be moved to the office unless you move to another department, which will not consider your application unless you are already in Cork. Just don't do it.  Any kind of criticism is heresy and will turn you into an outcast.  The salary is lower than the market average, which they try to even out by giving you a discount on their product every 3 years and a couple of shares every year.   One of their benefits should be paying for your training/certifications, but they only pay you Apple certifications from Pearsonvue, which they later do not allow you to have on your personal account, so keep that piece of paper safe since there is no way to get a duplicate or a link to it.  They will use leftovers from the kitchen to have ""free food"" events for employees. Enjoy your diarrhea.  The food is expensive and the quality is poor.  You are forced to watch their boring commercials during team meetings and pretend you like them."
